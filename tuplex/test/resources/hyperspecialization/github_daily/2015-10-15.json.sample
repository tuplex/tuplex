Dig works, however, so it's not clear if we are mishandling large responses or if go's srv lookup code is buggy.  Go is able to resolve small responses, when I only query for _leader._tcp.mesos.  I'm working around this in etcd-mesos by providing discoveryinfo that will limit the size of the response."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesosphere/mesos-dns/issues/comments/148236816","html_url":"https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-dns/issues/326#issuecomment-148236816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesosphere/mesos-dns/issues/326","id":148236816,"user":{"login":"s-urbaniak","id":375856,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/375856?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak","html_url":"https://github.com/s-urbaniak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-urbaniak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:00:01Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T00:00:01Z","body":"xref https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/854"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:00:01Z","org":{"id":3458585,"login":"mesosphere","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/mesosphere","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3458585?"}}

When the goal is to simply create a standalone document (or mostly standalone atm), I think the `data-uri` is sufficient. You don't really care how it's done, just that it's all one document. When the “how” matters, because it changes the behavior or capabilities, then you need to be more specific and use the hints. The inline hint brings the SVG data into the document (`<svg>` element), the interactive hint merely adds what can be added of interactivity while still linking to the resource (`<object>` element).\r\n\r\nIn summary, I do believe that we are talking about levels of behavior.\r\n\r\n> it makes the most sense to tag the image in asciidoc with the set of capabilities you want as directly as possible.\r\n\r\nI agree with this in theory. In practice, though, we don't want to annoy the author by making it unnecessarily verbose. I think a good API is as specific as necessary for the human to “get it”. Any more and it's just pageantry.\r\n\r\nA possible compromise is to require both options to get inline behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimage::sample.svg[opts=\"interactive,inline\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nalso written as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[%interactive%inline]\r\nimage::sample.svg[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could recognize \"inline\" as a shorthand (for those who really want to type less) but typing it out longhand would be permitted for clarity. (Building on something Sarah had suggested).\r\n\r\nThis seems like a reasonable compromise (for something that is turning out to be extremely difficult to define because there aren't well-defined lines or existing terminology). This way, we understand that \"inline\" represents all features that are enabled when the SVG data is imported into the document. We know the `<object>` element only gives us interactivity. (If there's a word other than \"interactive\" that can explain what `<object>` give it, I'm open to it)."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:00:17Z","org":{"id":3137042,"login":"asciidoctor","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/asciidoctor","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137042?"}}

Kafka is publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log.\r\nKafka sink just transforms the monitoring metrics and events to kafka message with two topics: timeseriestopic, eventstopic.\r\n\r\nTo use the kafka sink add the following flag:\r\n```\r\n--sink=kafka:<KAFKA_SERVER_URL>[?<OPTIONS>]\r\n```\r\nNormally, kafka server has multi brokers, so brokers' list need be configured for producer.\r\nSo, we can set `KAFKA_SERVER_URL` to a dummy value, and provide kafka brokers' list in url's query string.\r\nBesides,the following options need be set in query string:\r\n\r\n* `timeseriestopic` - Kafka's topic for timeseries\r\n* `eventstopic` - Kafka's topic for events\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n```\r\n--sink=kafka:http://kafka/?brokers=0.0.0.0:9092&brokers=0.0.0.0:9093&timeseriestopic=test&eventstopic=test

Kafka is publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log.\r\nKafka sink just transforms the monitoring metrics and events to kafka message with two topics: timeseriestopic, eventstopic.\r\n\r\nTo use the kafka sink add the following flag:\r\n```\r\n--sink=kafka:<KAFKA_SERVER_URL>[?<OPTIONS>]\r\n```\r\nNormally, kafka server has multi brokers, so brokers' list need be configured for producer.\r\nSo, we can set `KAFKA_SERVER_URL` to a dummy value, and provide kafka brokers' list in url's query string.\r\nBesides,the following options need be set in query string:\r\n\r\n* `timeseriestopic` - Kafka's topic for timeseries\r\n* `eventstopic` - Kafka's topic for events\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n```\r\n--sink=kafka:http://kafka/?brokers=0.0.0.0:9092&brokers=0.0.0.0:9093&timeseriestopic=test&eventstopic=test

I've seen this bug cause failures with the automatic backup role that runs at the end of the playbook. The failure aborts the backup process, and no encrypted tarball is written to the Admin Workstation. In order to force the backup, a manual rsync command is required, which sidesteps the MemoryError exception.\r\n\r\nThe problem is how to install a recent version of Ansible safely under Debian wheezy (which Tails 1.6 is based on).

StackOverflow.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ampproject/amphtml/issues/comments/148236893","html_url":"https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/481#issuecomment-148236893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ampproject/amphtml/issues/481","id":148236893,"user":{"login":"patrickhlauke","id":895831,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/895831?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke","html_url":"https://github.com/patrickhlauke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickhlauke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:00:32Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T00:00:32Z","body":"regarding fast click, though webkit's change is welcome, it's about 2 years late compared to other browsers, and less problematic solutions (such as removing the ~300ms delay for `width=device-width`, and the

This concept is so simple (only three steps!) yet somehow encompasses such key elements of the development process. I wonder how much time teams should spend in each cycle of the loop. I'm sure it depends on the project, but it would be interesting to know. \r\n\r\nPrior to business school, I consulted on a few large ERP implementations (SAP and Oracle). During those projects, it felt like we were in the Build stage FOREVER. Much of this was requirements gathering... I thought we would never move on to testing. I always enjoyed the Measure stage of projects because we could finally bring users in to see how they would respond to a product. It was always surprising to see what they would do / figure out / get confused by / etc. When you're so close to it for so long, it's hard to see it objectively!"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:00:33Z"}

boundaries).","created_at":"2015-10-13T23:56:44Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T00:01:09Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83c8e9a78e1a78820308c8caa568941a7a24ee4f","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-api-python-client/pulls/147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-api-python-client/pulls/147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-api-python-client/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-api-python-client/issues/147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-api-python-client/statuses/cd456d578174842e865a0547717bfc6440f9302f","head":{"label":"Rufflewind:binary-upload-python3","ref":"binary-upload-python3","sha":"cd456d578174842e865a0547717bfc6440f9302f","user":{"login":"Rufflewind","id":6571068,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6571068?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind","html_url":"https://github.com/Rufflewind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44207000,"name":"google-api-python-client","full_name":"Rufflewind/google-api-python-client","owner":{"login":"Rufflewind","id":6571068,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6571068?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind","html_url":"https://github.com/Rufflewind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rufflewind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client","description":"…","fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/google-api-python-client/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"

Vox may be tweaked later to exhale N2O.\r\n * Added: Robotics can make Advanced Lungs (programming 2, biomech 4), which are compatible with all species and filter out some gasses (N2O and plasma), up to certain partial pressures.\r\n\r\n# Sprites\r\nLungs:\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/PmHsmGk.png)\r\n\r\nEyes:\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/F4UUDrZ.png)\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n* [x] Livers\r\n* [x] Eyes"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3athrow/vgstation13/issues/comments/148237027","html_url":"https://github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/5669#issuecomment-148237027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3athrow/vgstation13/issues/5669","id":148237027,"user":{"login":"Angelite191","id":5303834,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5303834?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191","html_url":"https://github.com/Angelite191","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angelite191/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:01:41Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T00:01:41Z","body":"I may be retarded, but I still don't get it."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:01:41Z"}

I also fixed a warning in the Python spike queue.\r\n\r\nThere's one more issue, though. After removing the `codegen-independent` label from `test_cuda`, this now fails on Cython. The reason is a division by zero (that also raises a warning on numpy). I think this problem appears only now because the CUDA example can now use the exact integration and boolean variables are taken into account for the loop-invariant constants. The problem arises for the conductances `ge` and `gi` during the refractory period:\r\n```Python\r\n   # ...\r\n    _lio_const_5 = (dt * (taue - taum)) * _int(0.0)\r\n    _lio_const_6 = ((dt * (taue - taum)) * _int(1.0)) - ((dt * (taue - taum)) * _int(0.0))\r\n   # ...\r\n        _ge = (((((- ge) * taue) * taum) * (_lio_const_1 + (_lio_const_2 * _int(not_refractory)))) * (_lio_const_3 + (_lio_const_4 * _int(not_refractory)))) / (_lio_const_5 + (_lio_const_6 * _int(not_refractory)))\r\n```\r\nWhen `not_refractory` is `False`, then `int(not_refractory)` is 0 and therefore the whole divisor is zero (`_lio_const_5` is always zero). It does not matter in the end, since we don't write back the values during the refractory period, but we'll still get the error/warning. Is there a reason we have the division checks switched on for Cython, actually? The documentation says that it has an \"up to 35% speed penalty\" and given that there's no check with weave, this should probably simply switched off? This still leaves us with a warning in numpy, though."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brian-team/brian2/issues/comments/148237081","html_url":"https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/572#issuecomment-148237081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brian-team/brian2/issues/572","id":148237081,"user":{"login":"thesamovar","id":2903870,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2903870?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesamovar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamovar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:08Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:08Z","body":"OK, me too - merging!"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:09Z","org":{"id":2292949,"login":"brian-team","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/brian-team","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292949?"}}

I also fixed a warning in the Python spike queue.\r\n\r\nThere's one more issue, though. After removing the `codegen-independent` label from `test_cuda`, this now fails on Cython. The reason is a division by zero (that also raises a warning on numpy). I think this problem appears only now because the CUDA example can now use the exact integration and boolean variables are taken into account for the loop-invariant constants. The problem arises for the conductances `ge` and `gi` during the refractory period:\r\n```Python\r\n   # ...\r\n    _lio_const_5 = (dt * (taue - taum)) * _int(0.0)\r\n    _lio_const_6 = ((dt * (taue - taum)) * _int(1.0)) - ((dt * (taue - taum)) * _int(0.0))\r\n   # ...\r\n        _ge = (((((- ge) * taue) * taum) * (_lio_const_1 + (_lio_const_2 * _int(not_refractory)))) * (_lio_const_3 + (_lio_const_4 * _int(not_refractory)))) / (_lio_const_5 + (_lio_const_6 * _int(not_refractory)))\r\n```\r\nWhen `not_refractory` is `False`, then `int(not_refractory)` is 0 and therefore the whole divisor is zero (`_lio_const_5` is always zero). It does not matter in the end, since we don't write back the values during the refractory period, but we'll still get the error/warning. Is there a reason we have the division checks switched on for Cython, actually? The documentation says that it has an \"up to 35% speed penalty\" and given that there's no check with weave, this should probably simply switched off?

For example, the CUBA equations (ignoring refractoriness for now):\r\n```Python\r\neqs = Equations('''\r\ndv/dt  = (ge+gi-(v-El))/taum : volt                    \r\ndge/dt = -ge/taue : volt\r\ndgi/dt = -gi/taui : volt\r\n''')\r\n```\r\nare solved like this:\r\n```\r\nprint linear(eqs)\r\n_ge = -ge*taue*taum*(-dt/taum + dt/taue)*exp(-dt/taue)/(dt*(taue - taum))\r\n_gi = -gi*taui*taum*(-dt/taum + dt/taui)*exp(-dt/taui)/(dt*(taui - taum))\r\n_v = El - El*exp(-dt/taum) + ge*(-taue*exp(-dt/taum)/(taue - taum) + taue*exp(-dt/taue)/(taue - taum)) + gi*(-taui*exp(-dt/taum)/(taui - taum) + taui*exp(-dt/taui)/(taui - taum)) + v*exp(-dt/taum)\r\nge = _ge\r\ngi = _gi\r\nv = _v\r\n```\r\n\r\nSympy's `simplify` can rewrite it as:\r\n```\r\n_ge = ge*exp(-dt/taue)\r\n_gi = gi*exp(-dt/taui)\r\n_v = El - El*exp(-dt/taum) + ge*(-taue*exp(-dt/taum)/(taue - taum) + taue*exp(-dt/taue)/(taue - taum)) + gi*(-taui*exp(-dt/taum)/(taui - taum) + taui*exp(-dt/taui)/(taui - taum)) + v*exp(-dt/taum)\r\nge = _ge\r\ngi = _gi\r\nv = _v\r\n```\r\nBut for complicated equations, simplify is too slow and I'm therefore hesitant to use it here (see #384). In the \"unsimplified\" equations, we see that there is an unnecessary division by `dt*(taue - taum)` which does not enter into the results because it is cancelled by the same factor in the numerator but which can lead to a NaN if `taue == taum`. This might be unlikely, but as noted in #572 the same problem occurs with expressions that include the `is_refractory` variable which of course switches to `0` during refractoriness.\r\n\r\nA semi-solution:\r\n* Do not use simplify when checking whether equations can be integrated exactly (because this is called for every equation where `method` is not specified)\r\n* Use it when we decided that we integrate with the `linear` method  -- after all, this will most likely only be the case for relatively simple equations where `simplify` should only take a reasonable amount of time."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:12Z","org":{"id":2292949,"login":"brian-team","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/brian-team","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292949?"}}

this:\r\n```C#\r\nConsole.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(SHA1.Create().ComputeHash(File.ReadAllBytes(Console.ReadLine()))));\r\n```\r\nUsing forward pipe operator it can be written as (in the same order that they will be executed):\r\n```C#\r\nConsole.ReadLine()\r\n:> File.ReadAllBytes\r\n:> SHA1.Create().ComputeHash\r\n:> BitConverter.ToString\r\n:> Console.WriteLine;\r\n```\r\nWe can take a step further and specify named args (similar to currying proposed in #3171):\r\n```C#\r\nConsole.ReadLine()\r\n:> File.ReadAllBytes\r\n:> SHA1.Create().ComputeHash\r\n:> BitConverter.ToString\r\n:> Console.WriteLine(format: \"SHA1: {0}\");\r\n```\r\n*EDIT:* Note that `format` here, is the first parameter, meaning that the value forwarded to the second parameter, which is natural for currying by definition, but this can be extended to support other parameters based on some rules — like forwarding to the best overload's unspecified parameter.\r\n\r\nThe syntax also plays nice with #5402:\r\n```\r\nConsole.ReadLine()\r\n:> File.ReadAllBytes\r\n:> SHA1.Create().ComputeHash\r\n:> bytes => foreach(var b in bytes): Console.Write($\"{b:x2}\");\r\n``` \r\nAnd as mentioned in #5206 and discussed in #347 we can use tuples to support methods with multiple parameters:\r\n```C#\r\ntuple :> dictionary.Add;\r\n```\r\nTo prevent ambiguity, I think this should be allowed only in this context.\r\n\r\n*EDIT:* Syntax

Try to work through the challenges on your own, but don't get bogged down.\r\n\r\n### The Man With the Golden GitHub\r\n\r\nKeep building your _Responsive_ GitHub page. Tonight, try to get the tablet view done. After merging, cut a new `release--*` branch from `master` and a new branch from that called `feature--responsive-tablet`.\r\n\r\n### Etsy Goes Marching On\r\n\r\n**Time to switch Team Leads!**\r\n\r\nIf you're the _new_ lead, no coding for you! You must support the other two team members with planning, API reading, data analysis, and code review. Look over their shoulders and help them avoid painful syntax errors and split your time between them. There's plenty to do without writing anything.\r\n\r\nIf you _were_ the lead, pick up one of the existing, open tasks _before_ starting a new task. That doesn't have to be the new lead's old task, either. If your third teammate is stuck on something: trade. Rely on your _new_ Team Lead for direction and support.\r\n\r\nBetween the three of you, you should tackle  _at least one feature per person with HTML, (S)CSS, and some Angular JS placeholders_. With your new knowledge of the Etsy API and the `$http` service, load some data from your cache in `apis/etsy/` and pull it into your page to replace some placeholders.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:26Z","org":{"id":13875036,"login":"TIY-Durham","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/TIY-Durham","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13875036?"}}

Make sure `...\\node_modules\\.bin\\tern` is installed and on your PATH.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be specific to Windows installations. This PR fixes that issue.\r\n\r\nThe error is misleading because you don't actually need Tern to be in your PATH, nor does that solve the issue. The error appears because the `cwd` option is is a reference to a file, instead of a directory, when BufferedProcess is called.\r\n\r\nThis fix stops the process early when the project does not contain any paths, which is in agreement with the message given when you attempt to open the Tern Config in the same situation:\r\n\r\n> There is no active project.

After #9000, Spark had the following classes:\r\n\r\n- MemoryManager\r\n- StaticMemoryManager\r\n- ExecutorMemoryManager\r\n- TaskMemoryManager\r\n- ShuffleMemoryManager\r\n\r\nThis is fairly confusing. To simplify things, this patch consolidates several of these classes:\r\n\r\n- ShuffleMemoryManager and ExecutorMemoryManager were merged into MemoryManager.\r\n- TaskMemoryManager is moved into Spark Core.\r\n\r\nThis patch is currently a work-in-progress; the remaining TODOs:\r\n\r\n- [x] Merge ExecutorMemoryManager into MemoryManager.\r\n- [ ] Merge ShuffleMemoryManager into MemoryManager.\r\n- [x] Move TaskMemoryManager from `spark-unsafe` to `spark-core`.\r\n- [ ] Refactor TaskMemoryManager interactions so tasks use only this and not both this and ShuffleMemoryManager.\r\n- [ ] Misc. docs and cleanup.","created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:44Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0627a8a3010e0e35487d6b496390e144fd9516f9","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/9127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/9127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/25ba4b54b0a88ed7f6db75a2f1d4a9b55b98b294","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-10984","ref":"SPARK-10984","sha":"25ba4b54b0a88ed7f6db75a2f1d4a9b55b98b294","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

Doing so would prevent reuse for potential hypothetical functions like `mergeIntersection`.\r\n\r\n* to support filtering, the implementation currently excludes keys from the resulting object whose values are `undefined` – this feels like it overloads the behaviour of `mergeWith`/`mergeWithKeys` a little.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda/issues/comments/148237151","html_url":"https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/1443#issuecomment-148237151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda/issues/1443","id":148237151,"user":{"login":"scott-christopher","id":8951601,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8951601?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher","html_url":"https://github.com/scott-christopher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:48Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:48Z","body":"If we don't want the ability to filter in the internal `_mergeWith`, then I'd suggest `_mergeWith` should be removed and its implementation moved into `mergeWithKey`, as there isn't a whole lot more that it offers."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-10-15T00:02:50Z","org":{"id":5298359,"login":"ramda","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/ramda","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5298359?"}}
