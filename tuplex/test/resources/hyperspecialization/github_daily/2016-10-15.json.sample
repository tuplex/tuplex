This actually\r\naffects the new length of the slice calculation. For example,\r\n\r\n    > const original = Buffer.from('abcd');\r\n    undefined\r\n    > original.slice(original.length / 3).toString()\r\n    'bc'\r\n\r\nThis happens because, starting value of the slice is 4 / 3, which is\r\n1.33 (approximately). Now, the length of the slice is calculated as\r\nthe difference between the actual length of the buffer and the starting\r\noffset. So, it becomes 2.67 (4 - 1.33). Now, a new `FastBuffer` is\r\nconstructed, with these values, actual buffer object, starting value\r\nwhich is 1.33 and the the length 2.67. The underlying C++ code\r\ntruncates the numbers and they become 1 and 2. That is why the result\r\nis just `bc`.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes sure that all the offsets are coerced to an integer.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/9096\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc

A system for registering optional shader chunks is in place, and I have moved the simple initial lighting implementation into the shaderlib.\r\n\r\n- The Intel precision fix (high precision tan) was probably lost but should be easy to add back using the new shader assembly system.\r\n\r\n- The ScatterplotLayer now sizes its points in meters. This means that they disappear when viewed from a distance. We should decide what the desired behavior is here.\r\n\r\n- The GridLayer is broken again, its display appears to depend on whether other layers are displayed. Will be fixed later.\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:09Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:09Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uber/deck.gl/pulls/104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uber/deck.gl/pulls/104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uber/deck.gl/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uber/deck.gl/issues/104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uber/deck.gl/statuses/4e2d44f30868005bb77c21b7147c46cf2caad48f","head":{"label":"uber:projection-modes","ref":"projection-modes","sha":"4e2d44f30868005bb77c21b7147c46cf2caad48f","user":{"login":"uber","id":538264,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538264?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber","html_url":"https://github.com/uber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48030204,"name":"deck.gl","full_name":"uber/deck.gl","owner":{"login":"uber","id":538264,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538264?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber","html_url":"https://github.com/uber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uber/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/uber/deck.gl","description":"A

Even with a large brim around the objects this does not solve the problem because the second layer gets a lot of force and breaks off.\r\n\r\nPossible solution: Where possible increase the surface area of the support material that is attached to the bed and the strength of the lower layers, possibly by giving it flared bottom layers or increasing the thickness of the lower layers or both. Neither of these suggestions will make it more difficult to remove support material from the models.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to have bridges at different layer heights between nearby support material towers so that if one of the support material structures broke off the based or further up it would be held together and could recover more easily. The bridges could be at lots of different layer heights so that you wouldn't get weak layers. These bridges could be more frequent at the lower levels where the towers have the highest stress points.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/comments/253946917","html_url":"https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/3517#issuecomment-253946917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/3517","id":253946917,"user":{"login":"soswow","id":108065,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108065?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow","html_url":"https://github.com/soswow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soswow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:17Z","body":"eh ... after 3 hours trying to install everything (perl, perlbrew, local-lib), when on every step something was failing, so I had to use --force or -f ... it still failed in the end.

Moreover, a change in\ngeneric part of the kernel can lead to mysteriously missing exports\non some configs.  With this change we don't have to worry about\nthat anymore.\n\nOne side effect is that built-in.o now pulls everything with exports\nfrom the corresponding lib.a (if such exists).  That's exactly what\nwe want for linking vmlinux and fortunately it's almost the only thing\nbuilt-in.o is used in.  arch/ia64/hp/sim/boot/bootloader is the only\nexception and it's easy to get rid of now - just turn everything in\narch/ia64/lib into lib-* and don't bother with arch/ia64/lib/built-in.o\nanymore.\n\n[AV: stylistic fix from Michal folded in]\n\nAcked-by: Michal Marek <mmarek@suse.cz>\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/7f2084fa55e6cb61f61b4224d4a8bafaeee55f9f"},{"sha":"22823ab419d8ed884195cfa75483fd3a99bb1462","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"EXPORT_SYMBOL() for asm\n\nAdd asm-usable variants of EXPORT_SYMBOL/EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.  This\ncommit just adds the default implementation; most of the architectures\ncan simply add export.h to asm/Kbuild and start using <asm/export.h>\nfrom assembler.  The rest needs to have their <asm/export.h> define\neveral macros and then explicitly include <asm-generic/export.h>\n\nOne area where the things might diverge from default is the alignment;\nnormally it's 8 bytes on 64bit targets and 4 on 32bit ones, both for\nunsigned long and for struct kernel_symbol.  Unfortunately, amd64 and\nm68k are unusual - m68k aligns to 2 bytes (for both) and amd64 aligns\nstruct kernel_symbol to 16 bytes.  For those we'll need asm/export.h to\noverride the constants used by generic version - KSYM_ALIGN and KCRC_ALIGN\nfor kernel_symbol and unsigned long resp.  And no, __alignof__ would not\ndo the trick - on amd64 __alignof__ of struct kernel_symbol is 8, not 16.\n\nMore serious source of unpleasantness is treatment of function\ndescriptors on architectures that have those.  Things like ppc64,\nparisc, ia64, etc.  need more than the address of the first insn to\ncall an arbitrary function.  As the result, their representation of\npointers to functions is not the typical \"address of the entry point\" -\nit's an address of a small static structure containing all the required\ninformation (including the entry point, of course).  Sadly, the asm-side\nconventions differ in what the function name refers to - entry point or\nthe function descriptor.  On ppc64 we do the latter;\n\tbar: .quad foo\nis what void (*bar)(void) = foo; turns into and the rare places where\nwe need to explicitly work with the label of entry point are dealt with\nas DOTSYM(foo).  For our purposes it's ideal - generic macros are usable.\nHowever, parisc would have foo and P%foo used for label of entry point\nand address of the function descriptor and\n\tbar: .long P%foo\nwoudl be used instead.\tia64 goes similar to parisc in that respect,\nexcept that there it's @fptr(foo) rather than P%foo.  Such architectures\nneed to define KSYM_FUNC that would turn a function name into whatever\nis needed to refer to function descriptor.\n\nWhat's more, on such architectures we need to know whether we are exporting\na function or an object - in assembler we have to tell that explicitly, to\ndecide whether we want EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo) produce e.g.\n\t__ksymtab_foo: .quad foo\nor\n\t__ksymtab_foo: .quad @fptr(foo)\n\nFor that reason we introduce EXPORT_DATA_SYMBOL{,_GPL}(), to be used for\nexports of data objects.  On normal architectures it's the same thing\nas EXPORT_SYMBOL{,_GPL}(), but on parisc-like ones they differ and the\nright one needs to be used.  Most of the exports are functions, so we\nkeep EXPORT_SYMBOL for those...\n\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/22823ab419d8ed884195cfa75483fd3a99bb1462"},{"sha":"784d5699eddc55878627da20d3fe0c8542e2f1a2","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"x86: move exports to actual definitions\n\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/784d5699eddc55878627da20d3fe0c8542e2f1a2"},{"sha":"00fc0e0dda6286407f3854cd71a125f519a5689c","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"alpha: move exports to actual definitions\n\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/00fc0e0dda6286407f3854cd71a125f519a5689c"},{"sha":"d13ffb5630443e6112df0263969cbdfc8ab9ab57","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"m68k: move exports to definitions\n\nAcked-by: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/d13ffb5630443e6112df0263969cbdfc8ab9ab57"},{"sha":"711f5df7bf3ae7657e15edf76d671042c051ce95","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"s390: move exports to definitions\n\nAcked-by: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/711f5df7bf3ae7657e15edf76d671042c051ce95"},{"sha":"4dd1837d7589f468ed109556513f476e7a7f9121","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"arm: move exports to definitions\n\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/4dd1837d7589f468ed109556513f476e7a7f9121"},{"sha":"9445aa1a3062a75a4d9de78026816ebc941e7b99","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"ppc: move exports to definitions\n\nSigned-off-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moontide/linux/commits/9445aa1a3062a75a4d9de78026816ebc941e7b99"},{"sha":"d3867f0483103b8ff7edfdea3ef1981c03d96891","author":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"de609eb4d5d70b1d38ec6642adbfc33a2781f63c@zeniv.linux.org.uk"},"message":"sparc: move exports to definitions\n\nAcked-by: David S.

This is due to the Queue processing loop not recognizing it's playing already, and as such tries to fulfill the loop again, conflicting with the existing player.\r\n\r\n* The player doesn't continue playing the queue after doing forceskip, stop, or disconnect. A temporary measure was to reload the file in order for it to continue.\r\n\r\n* The player didn't recognize it was already disconnected after using disconnect. Using summon caused it to show the \"I'm already in your channel\" error message."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/QualityCogs/QualityCogs/issues/comments/253946932","html_url":"https://github.com/QualityCogs/QualityCogs/pull/13#issuecomment-253946932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/QualityCogs/QualityCogs/issues/13","id":253946932,"user":{"login":"Aioxas","id":20670805,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20670805?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas","html_url":"https://github.com/Aioxas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aioxas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:22Z","body":"Yes.

@alena1108 There are actually two cases under Scenario 2.\r\n\r\n1. There's an error in the Compose file itself, such as a syntax error or a wrong type used somewhere. Regardless of where this occurs in the file, the stack will throw an error and no services will be created.\r\n2. There's a semantic error in one of the attributes for a service. In this case Rancher Compose can't validate everything ahead of time since it's creating services one at a time.\r\n\r\nCase 1 seems to be fine. To fix case 2 I'd need some sort of validation API for a launch config.

I could take a look at a JSON branch and port the patch over there. Although I do find it weird that you would switch the settings to a JSON format, INI files are perfectly fine for storing settings and JSON only presents benefits over it as an exchange format. With that said, adding a migration path to JSON right after the migration code added by this patch will save you from having to maintain either the old paths or the old format.\r\n\r\nXDG specs are a widely-used convention and in fact because of it, it does have an effect on how users perceive the software. See bug reports for: [Thunderbird](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=735285), [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1734), [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259356), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-22407), [Telegram](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/1238), [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3884), [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/175), [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonmac.com/en/issue-5164.html)... I could go on.\r\n\r\nMany users simply don't like seeing their Home folders polluted with a folder for every application, and  for every one of those that don't follow the spec there's a need for a special case in any configuration backup script.\r\n\r\nBy fixing this bug you wouldn't add any work for yourself because that's what the spec is made to solve. Configuration files go to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ssr`, which is `~/.config/ssr` by default. Other data files such as logs, go to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ssr`, `~/.local/share/ssr` by default; and that's consistent. Users expect Linux applications to respect those conventions, so that's what they go for. The patch is ready, and even if you do end up switching file formats, no code would break as long as you call the right functions `GetApplicationConfigDir` and `GetApplicationDataDir` (with the existing calls to the removed `GetApplicationDataDir` already replaced in the patch), the migration code and those functions take care of everything."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:42Z"}

This jar makes easier to run the examples directly from the terminal\r\n  using the traditional java command. Having Maven installed, below are the command line instructions to build and run the examples:\r\n  - at the root folder of the CloudSim Plus, build the project typing `mvn package`\r\n  - at the cloudsim-plus-examples/target folder, run a example (such as the number 1), typing `java -cp cloudsim-plus-examples-1.0-with-dependencies.jar org.cloudbus.cloudsim.examples.CloudSimExample1`\r\n  - realise that you have to change the 1.0 version at the name of the jar file in the instruction above to the actual CloudSim Plus version you are using\r\n- The script in `script/bootstrap.sh` was also updated to make it easier to use. Now, if it is called whitout parameters, it shows\r\n  an usage help. It is in fact the easier way to build the project and run examples. \r\n  To run the same example 1, it is as easy as typing `./bootstrap.sh org.cloudbus.cloudsim.examples.CloudSimExample1` inside the `script` folder.\r\n  It will automatically discover the exact name of the examples jar file to run, whatever its version number is.\r\n- Inclusion of new module \"cloudsim-plus-benchmarks\" that uses [JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness framework)](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) that implement some\r\n  benchmarks in order to assess CloudSim Plus performance.\r\n- Inclusion of new module \"cloudsim-plus-testbeds\" to provide a set of more complex and comprehensive \r\n  testbeds used to assess implementation of algorithms for different purposes such as:\r\n\tmapping of Cloudlets to VMs, allocation and scheduling policies, resource utilization models or VM placement and migration policies.\r\n  These testbeds also show how to apply statistical methods to get scientifically valid simulation results. \r\n  Some method to reduce confidence interval and correlation are implemented and can be used for several experiments. \r\n- Some issues closed  "}},"public":true,"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:50Z"}

this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n\r\nExpanding the group of people who are able to review PRs is important for the growing community of Kubernetes contributors. This change uses git commit history to calculate a list of possible reviewers for various parts of the project. \r\n\r\n**Which issue this PR fixes**\r\n `fixes #1422,#1389` \r\n\r\n**Release note**\r\n\r\nThe list of reviewers to OWNERS files has been updated using tooling [contributed by CoreOS](https://github.com/coreos/findowner) Thanks @hongchaodeng! \r\n\r\n**Overview**\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a set of reviewers to OWNERS files across various\r\npackages in Kubernetes. The big idea is to maintain this list of people\r\nwho have worked on parts of the Kubernetes code base who can potentially\r\nhelp with code reviews. This list will be consumed by bots that will\r\nautomatically ask people to review code and assign PRs for review.\r\n\r\nDiscussions:\r\n- https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/1422\r\n- https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/1389\r\n- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-wg-contribex/EEEyMisp0M4\r\n\r\n**Selected Reviewers**\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 270 people identified for the role of pkg level\r\nreviewer based on their work in various packages. Each of these people will be contacted via the email associated with their account in order to confirm their participation as a reviewer\r\nOf course if anyone wishes to opt out immediately they can comment on this PR:\r\n\r\nYou may opt-out in two different ways:\r\n\r\n1. Remove permanently; your GitHub handle will be added to a blacklist\r\n2. Remove from a single package; your GitHub handle will be added to a\r\npkg blacklist and removed from this patch\r\n\r\nPlease comment on this issue if you want to opt-out. See the patch for\r\nthe pkgs you are in.\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\n\r\nThe basic algorithm:\r\n- Walk directories of \"pkg\" and gather up commit history\r\n- It selects top N (default is 3) committers for each directory. If there are more than N people having the same number of commits, it outputs them all.\r\n- It ranks people (identified by GitHub handle) by the number of commits they made.\r\n- The commits are pulled from past two years history excluding \"merge\" commits.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/coreos/findowner\r\n\r\n*Implementation Notes*\r\n\r\n- It has a depth limit (default is 3). For example, given depth limit 3, \"./pkg/apis/apps\" is allowed, while \"./pkg/apis/apps/install\" isn't.\r\n- It has an excluded list. See \"./main.go\" excludedDirList variable.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.kubernetes.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.kubernetes.io/reviews/kubernetes/kubernetes/31752)\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/comments/253946992","html_url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/31752#issuecomment-253946992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/31752","id":253946992,"user":{"login":"bgrant0607","id":7725777,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7725777?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607","html_url":"https://github.com/bgrant0607","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrant0607/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:53Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:00:53Z","body":"@calebamiles @grodrigues3 I don't think a simple git-based extractor is going to work.

I'm pretty sure this needs more documentation. Please do clone this down and look at it using the godoc web interface or CLI and let me know if there're things which aren't clear from the existing docs.\r\n2. What do you think about naming it `svcdef`? Should that be changed? What do you think would be the best name?\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n# What?\r\n\r\nIn short, `deftree` is a big mess that's not good at what we use it for, so we're gonna replace it with this new thing called `svcdef`.\r\n\r\n# Why?\r\n\r\n`deftree` is intended to hold all the info we may need to generate a service. However, `deftree` exclusively derives it's information from the parsing of the input proto files. This sounds fine in priciple, but when generating code, we have to generate code which co-operates with the go code generated by `protoc-gen-go`. Now, you may notice a problem here: how can we generate code to interoperate with the code from `protoc-gen-go` if we haven't directly inspected the output code from `protoc-gen-go`?\r\n\r\nThe answer till now has been: by making some (not always sound) assumptions. Since the code generated by `protoc-gen-go` is also based on the same protobuf definition files we are provided, it is possible *in theory* to infer the state of the code generated by `protoc-gen-go` and generate our own code which interoperates with our correctly-infered code. But our inferences aren't always correct, and even if they are they frequently don't handle edge cases in the code we must interoperate with.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds overly complicated and error prone, that's because it has been.\r\n\r\nIn short, **`deftree` only indirectly gives us the information we need to generate working and reliable code, which is why `svcdef` has been written.**\r\n\r\n# How?\r\n\r\nHow does `svcdef` suceed where `deftree` failed? By getting it's information from the go files we need to interoperate with. Instead of deriving it's information from protobuf files, `svcdef` derives its info from the go files created by `protoc-gen-go` (and by reading the protobuf files for their http annotations). By sourcing it's information directly from the go files, `svcdef` provides much more accurate information that doesn't have to be massaged to generate correct code in the way the output of `deftree` does. Additionally, because the golang `go/ast` package for parsing go files is :+1::100:amazing, we can extract this more accurate and useful information with **80% less code** than `deftree`!\r\n\r\n# Does this break anything?\r\n\r\nAs of right now, no! But that's because this is only the implementation of `svcdef`, this PR does not include the changes to the rest of `truss` to use `svcdef` instead of `deftree`. That change is going to come later. The first goal is to get eyes on this code before we spend more time migrating things over."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TuneLab/go-truss/issues/comments/253947014","html_url":"https://github.com/TuneLab/go-truss/pull/71#issuecomment-253947014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TuneLab/go-truss/issues/71","id":253947014,"user":{"login":"hasLeland","id":19537833,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19537833?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland","html_url":"https://github.com/hasLeland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasLeland/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:01:04Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:01:04Z","body":"Alright, I believe I've adressed all the items in this code review.

I'm not sure if there were changes in the wallaby config API or if Jest 16 screwed something up (from looking at other issues it looks like the latter is not the case).\r\n\r\nHere's the repo if you'd like to see what I have going on: https://github.com/dsifford/academic-bloggers-toolkit\r\n\r\n### Wallaby.js configuration file\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    files: [\r\n        'src/**/*.{tsx,ts}',\r\n        'types/**/*.d.ts',\r\n        './package.json',\r\n        {\r\n            pattern: 'scripts/*.js',\r\n            instrument: false,\r\n        },\r\n        '!src/lib/js/utils/Externals.ts',\r\n        '!src/**/__tests__/*',\r\n        '!src/**/index.{ts,tsx}',\r\n        '!src/lib/js/Frontend.ts',\r\n        '!src/lib/js/utils/TinymceFunctions.ts',\r\n    ],\r\n    tests: [\r\n        'src/**/__tests__/*-test.{ts,tsx}',\r\n    ],\r\n    env: {\r\n        type: 'node',\r\n        runner: 'node',\r\n    },\r\n    testFramework: 'jest',\r\n    setup(wallaby) {\r\n        wallaby.testFramework.configure(require('./package.json').jest); // eslint-disable-line\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code editor or IDE name and version\r\n\r\nAtom...\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.10.2\r\nElectron: 0.37.8\r\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\r\nNode    : 5.10.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OS name and version\r\n\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance for the help. 😄 \r\n\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wallabyjs/public/issues/comments/253947042","html_url":"https://github.com/wallabyjs/public/issues/828#issuecomment-253947042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wallabyjs/public/issues/828","id":253947042,"user":{"login":"ArtemGovorov","id":979966,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/979966?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov","html_url":"https://github.com/ArtemGovorov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArtemGovorov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:01:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:01:17Z","body":"Got the branch, did `npm install` and everything seems to be working for me (`0 failing tests, 144 passing`):\r\n<img width=\"792\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-15 at 10 00 23 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/979966/19405711/3d37cea6-92be-11e6-9447-c1d2395faceb.png\">"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:01:17Z","org":{"id":9921462,"login":"wallabyjs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/wallabyjs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9921462?"}}

The approach we're currently taking by hardcoding the Ice version means there can be a mismatch between the Ice jars and the slice2xxx tool.  If we select the jar version based upon the slice2xxx version, then they are guaranteed to match.\r\n\r\nThe Ice DB jar is a special case.  They don't provide it in maven and prefer you to build from source on each platform.  This suggests that the approach we're taking here is wrong and maybe always has been.  ice-db may be broken on all platforms except the one it's build for, or at the least non-functional on platforms without the native DB library for the JNI wrapper to use.\r\n\r\n# Related reading\r\n\r\nLink to cards, tickets, other PRs:\r\n\r\n1. https://trello.com/c/Mf5R0YeD/207-ice-3-6-3-broke-omero-build\r\n2. https://forums.zeroc.com/discussion/46478/ice-3-6-3-regression-slice2java-generates-invalid-code#latest\r\n\r\n--breaking","created_at":"2016-10-15T00:01:27Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:01:27Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4449b4e6a96c26ac90a2458fa679ace7f77292c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/pulls/4893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/pulls/4893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/issues/4893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/statuses/a90f97c077ea2d87ff02014b44b21f5809886f19","head":{"label":"rleigh-codelibre:ice-3.6.3","ref":"ice-3.6.3","sha":"a90f97c077ea2d87ff02014b44b21f5809886f19","user":{"login":"rleigh-codelibre","id":9640520,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9640520?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre","html_url":"https://github.com/rleigh-codelibre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4574304,"name":"openmicroscopy","full_name":"rleigh-codelibre/openmicroscopy","owner":{"login":"rleigh-codelibre","id":9640520,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9640520?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre","html_url":"https://github.com/rleigh-codelibre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleigh-codelibre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/rleigh-codelibre/openmicroscopy","description":"OME (Open Microscopy Environment) develops open-source software and data format standards for the storage and manipulation of biological light microscopy data.

The expect script by itself runs fine, and $? returns 0. However, when run from kyua the test fails.\r\n\r\nThe expect script spawns a program in the current directory and interacts with it. If the absolute path of the program is hardcoded into the expect script kyua successfully runs the test, otherwise it fails.\r\n\r\nThe line that causes the problem is `spawn [pwd]/myprogram` which, if printed, correctly resolves to the absolute location of the program being tested, and when run directly works as it should.\r\n\r\nI've written other tests in sh that dynamically build the absolute path to the binary and they work fine.

But, the problem is actually not that there is a C-style cast to `void *` in the actual source code. The actual code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (m_rawBuffer == MAP_FAILED)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's happening here turns out to be a well-known issue: `MAP_FAILED` on some platforms gets turned into a C-style cast. For example, in the Dart language, they solve this problem by [re-defining the macro](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/runtime/vm/virtual_memory_macos.cc#L23) as a `reinterpret_cast`. I confirmed that this is really the problem by re-defining `MAP_FAILED` everywhere I found it. (Currently, 3 files: `AlignedBuffer.cpp`, `PackedArray.cpp`, and `SimpleBuffer.cpp`.)\r\n\r\nOff the cuff, there are a few solutions to this problem, each in projects of good repute:\r\n\r\n* Re-define `MAP_FAILED`. Because the uses of `MAP_FAILED` are constrained to .cpp files, this can be done either by creating a common header or by just re-defining it in ever .cpp file. Both are ugly; the second doesn't really prevent this from breaking the build again.\r\n* Add something like `#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Wold-style-cast\"` to each use of `MAP_FAILED`. Also ugly, and does not prevent this from breaking the build again.\r\n* Wrap `mmap` to abstract this problem away. Doesn't solve the problem of people forgetting to use the wrapper instead of normal `mmap`."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BitFunnel/BitFunnel/issues/comments/253947109","html_url":"https://github.com/BitFunnel/BitFunnel/issues/233#issuecomment-253947109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BitFunnel/BitFunnel/issues/233","id":253947109,"user":{"login":"danluu","id":157136,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157136?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu","html_url":"https://github.com/danluu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danluu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T00:02:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T00:02:13Z","body":"I don't have a strong opinion on this.
