In the first version this is just for the \"rival 310\" but the driver should be usable for the other models with minor adjustments in the driver.\r\n\r\nThe driver does not yet support button mappings or any of the non-solid LED modes. Resolutions, report rate, and solid colors on two LEDs are working.\r\n\r\nI open this PR now for two reasons. I would like to include it in the current form. I have found a couple of other developers I would like to attract to the project. And being able to set some but not all available settings is better than nothing I guess :) \r\n\r\nThe other reason is to discuss some issues with the device. It does not support reading out the current onboard configuration. This is of course bad for the experience in piper. For now the driver just picks some default values during probe that I found sensible What do we do for such a device? One solution could be to store the configuration on disk and load that during probe. Not ideal, but better than a full reset every time. Or should we simply not support devices with such limitations?\r\n\r\nOne of the LEDs is placed within the scroll wheel. I think we need a new LED TYPE for that. I have seen some of the logitech mice do the same. Is there a reason such a type does not exist

If this seems worthwhile, I'll continue working on this branch!\r\n\r\nThis branch partially addresses https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/issues/141 by updating how a repository's issues and pull requests are fetched, so we use v4 of the GitHub API instead of v3. What's missing currently is the views for individual issues and pull requests are not working because they're still expecting data in the v3 format instead of v4. I added a new `getPullRequests` function because PRs are not automatically returned in the list of issues in v4 of the API.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple style changes I didn't intentionally make. 🤔 I believe when I commit my changes, a git hook is doing some automatic style fixes and it's adjusting lines I didn't otherwise touch. Specifically, it's removing extra parentheses from around components. Is this expected?\r\n\r\nThis branch also adds me to the contributors list. 🎉

The problem with that is that the\ncode also uses error to print warnings, and informative messages.\nAll of this leads to problems where just having warnings will\nproduce an exit status as-if errors had been seen.\n\nTo fix this situation I have adopted the following high-level\nchanges:\n* All errors are counted distinctly.\n* All warnings are counted distinctly.\n* All informative messages are not counted.\n* Increasing verbosity cannot generate *more* errors, and\n  it previously did for errors conditional on verbose,\n  this is now fixed.\n* Increasing verbosity *can* generate *more* warnings.\n* Making the output quiet cannot generate *fewer* errors,\n  and it previously did for errors conditional on be_quiet,\n  this is now fixed.\n* Each of error, warning, and informative message has it's\n  own function to call defined in record-status.h, and they\n  are: record_error, record_warning, and record_verbose.\n* The record_error function always records an error, but\n  conditional on be_quiet may not print it.\n* The record_warning function always records a warning,\n  but conditional on be_quiet may not print it.\n* The record_verbose function only prints the verbose\n  message if verbose is true and be_quiet is false.\n\nThis has allowed the following fix:\n* Previously any warnings were being treated as errors\n  because they incremented error_message_count, but now\n  we properly return an exit status of 1 if there are\n  warnings but output was generated.\n\nAll of this allows localedef to correctly decide if errors,\nor warnings were present, and produce the correct exit code.\n\nThe locale and iconv programs now also use record-status.h\nand we have removed the WITH_CUR_LOCALE hack, and instead\nhave internal push_locale/pop_locale functions centralized\nin the record routines.\n\nSigned-off-by: Carlos O'Donell <carlos@redhat.com>","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bminor/glibc/commits/f16491eb8ebbef402f3da6f4035ce70fe36dec97"},{"sha":"a3e23a2c1d9e871545c6f438a41fcb8ad429cf70","author":{"name":"Carlos O'Donell","email":"ab5e2bca84933118bbc9d48ffaccce3bac4eeb64@systemhalted.org"},"message":"locale: Allow \"\" int_curr_Symbol (bug 22294)\n\nThe builtin POSIX locale has \"\" as the international currency symbol,\nbut a non-builtin locale may not have such a blank int_curr_symbol.\n\nTherefore to support non-builtin locales with similar \"\" int_curr_symbol\nwe adjust the LC_MONETARY parser to allow the normal 4-character\nint_curr_symbol *and* the empty \"\" no symbol.

However, it seems like using\nTRY/CATCH directly instead ends up producing clearer and easier to\ndebug code.  This is what this commit does.\n\nNote that removing catch_errors exposes further cleanup opportunities\naround no longer having to follow catch_errors callback type, and also\nremoves a few cleanups.\n\nI didn't do anything to save/restore current_uiout because I think\nthat should be the responsibility of the code that changes\ncurrent_uiout in the first place.\n\n(Another approach could be to make catch_errors a variadic template\nlike:\n\n  template<typename Function, typename... Args>\n  int catch_errors (const char *errstring, return_mask mask,\n\t\t    Function &&func, Args... args);\n\nand then with:\n\n  extern void function_with_args (int, int);\n  extern void function_with_no_args ();\n\ncalls to the above functions would be wrapped like this:\n\n  catch_errors (\"some error happened\", RETURN_MASK_ERROR,\n                function_with_args, arg1, arg2);\n\n  catch_errors (\"some error happened\", RETURN_MASK_ERROR,\n                function_with_no_args);\n\nbut I'm thinking that that doesn't improve much if at all either.)\n\ngdb/ChangeLog\n2017-10-10  Pedro Alves  <palves@redhat.com>\n\t    Tom Tromey  <tom@tromey.com>\n\n\t* breakpoint.c (breakpoint_cond_eval): Change return type to bool\n\tand reverse logic.\n\t(WP_DELETED, WP_VALUE_CHANGED, WP_VALUE_NOT_CHANGED, WP_IGNORE):\n\tNo longer macros.

From method tracing, it looks like the culprit is that the `Class.getCanonicalName()` method can be really slow, particularly when called on inner classes.\r\n\r\nFor one injection that I profiled, `AndroidSupportInjection.inject()` takes 1.074s of CPU time as measured in the profiler. Of that, the two calls to `getCanonicalName()` for the logger call take 67ms and 164ms respectively. Then the call to `DispatchingAndroidInjector.inject()` takes 696ms, all of which is spent inside `maybeInject()`. That method spends 483ms on another call to `getCanonicalName()`, and then finally 209ms for the generated `inject()` method for my fragment's subcomponent.\r\n\r\nThis means that 66.5% of the total time for the injection was spent inside calls to `getCanonicalName()`. The last instance is particularly annoying, because it's only used as a parameter to `checkNotNull()` and the resulting string value is only used if the injection fails and is a complete waste of time on success path.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways that this time could be improved:\r\n- Issue #790 has already been raised to remove the logger statement, which would remove the first two calls to `getCanonicalName()`.\r\n- Calls to `checkNotNull()` should only evaluate `getCanonicalName()` on `Class` objects if the reference being checked was actually null. All of the calls to it that pass `foo.getClass().getCanonicalName()` would just pass the class instance instead, and `getCanonicalName()` would only be called before throwing `NullPointerException`.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/dagger/issues/comments/336675960","html_url":"https://github.com/google/dagger/issues/819#issuecomment-336675960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/dagger/issues/819","id":336675960,"user":{"login":"ronshapiro","id":792797,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/792797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro","html_url":"https://github.com/ronshapiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-15T00:01:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T00:01:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for not doing this yet - this is totally reasonable.

If this seems worthwhile, I'll continue working on this branch!\r\n\r\nThis branch partially addresses https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/issues/141 by updating how a repository's issues and pull requests are fetched, so we use v4 of the GitHub API instead of v3. What's missing currently is the views for individual issues and pull requests are not working because they're still expecting data in the v3 format instead of v4. I added a new `getPullRequests` function because PRs are not automatically returned in the list of issues in v4 of the API.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple style changes I didn't intentionally make. 🤔 I believe when I commit my changes, a git hook is doing some automatic style fixes and it's adjusting lines I didn't otherwise touch. Specifically, it's removing extra parentheses from around components. Is this expected?\r\n\r\nThis branch also adds me to the contributors list. 🎉

From method tracing, it looks like the culprit is that the `Class.getCanonicalName()` method can be really slow, particularly when called on inner classes.\r\n\r\nFor one injection that I profiled, `AndroidSupportInjection.inject()` takes 1.074s of CPU time as measured in the profiler. Of that, the two calls to `getCanonicalName()` for the logger call take 67ms and 164ms respectively. Then the call to `DispatchingAndroidInjector.inject()` takes 696ms, all of which is spent inside `maybeInject()`. That method spends 483ms on another call to `getCanonicalName()`, and then finally 209ms for the generated `inject()` method for my fragment's subcomponent.\r\n\r\nThis means that 66.5% of the total time for the injection was spent inside calls to `getCanonicalName()`. The last instance is particularly annoying, because it's only used as a parameter to `checkNotNull()` and the resulting string value is only used if the injection fails and is a complete waste of time on success path.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways that this time could be improved:\r\n- Issue #790 has already been raised to remove the logger statement, which would remove the first two calls to `getCanonicalName()`.\r\n- Calls to `checkNotNull()` should only evaluate `getCanonicalName()` on `Class` objects if the reference being checked was actually null. All of the calls to it that pass `foo.getClass().getCanonicalName()` would just pass the class instance instead, and `getCanonicalName()` would only be called before throwing `NullPointerException`.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/dagger/issues/comments/336675966","html_url":"https://github.com/google/dagger/issues/819#issuecomment-336675966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/dagger/issues/819","id":336675966,"user":{"login":"ronshapiro","id":792797,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/792797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro","html_url":"https://github.com/ronshapiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronshapiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-15T00:01:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T00:01:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"*discouraging it beyond Dagger"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-10-15T00:01:22Z","org":{"id":1342004,"login":"google","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/google","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?"}}

This is because many of the formulas used (if you look at their source, Luke, Y. L. (1969), The Special Functions and Their Approximations Volume 1, section 6.2) come with the condition that |z| < 1\r\n\r\nI don't think this will lead to any invalid results, but I'm not very familiar with the hyper-geometric function.\r\n\r\nFixes #13133, but at the moment it returns an unevaluated limit because of an issue where limits can't deal with inverse hyperbolic functions, even though they can evaluate it if the functions are rewritten in terms of logs.

Only the string is used. You could probably create a struct called strings that contains a couple of other structs like Errors and Actions,  that only containa  a bunch of string properties each so when you need i.e noClipsAvailable, you can just say, Constants.Strings.Errors.noClipsAvailble.
