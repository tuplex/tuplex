What bugs does this change fix?\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the `test_packaging.py` we are trying to install `kafka` for which i have few concerns:\r\n- It requires 3 agents to run. The intention of this test is to ensure the `/package/install` endpoint works. We should not have to require 3 agent nodes to test this functionality.\r\n- Looking at the [history of this test in teamcity](https://teamcity.mesosphere.io/project.html?tab=testDetails&testNameId=-1224229538779150681&projectId=DcOs), I found out that the test has `0.0%` success rate. (It failed everytime it was ran, and it was ignored most of the time).\r\n\r\nBased on above, I decided to install `nginx` instead of `kafka` which requires only one agent node for a successful install.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Corresponding DC/OS tickets (obligatory)\r\n\r\nThese DC/OS JIRA ticket(s) must be updated (ideally closed) in the moment this PR lands:\r\n\r\n  - [DCOS_OSS-4221](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS_OSS-4221) Install nginx instead of kafka to ensure the test runs in clusters of smaller sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related tickets (optional)\r\n\r\nOther tickets related to this change:\r\n\r\n  - [DCOS_OSS-<number>](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS_OSS-<number>) Foo the Bar so it stops Bazzing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist for all PRs\r\n\r\n  - [x] Added a comprehensible changelog entry to `CHANGES.md` or explain why this is not a user-facing change: This is only adding an integration tests\r\n  - [x] Included a test which will fail if code is reverted but test is not. If there is no test please explain here: No such test\r\n  - [x] Read the [DC/OS contributing guidelines](https://github.com/dcos/dcos/blob/master/contributing.md)\r\n  - [x] Followed relevant code rules [Rules for Packages and Systemd](https://github.com/dcos/dcos/tree/master/docs)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist for component/package updates:\r\n\r\nIf you are changing components or packages in DC/OS (e.g. you are bumping the sha or ref of anything underneath `packages`), then in addition to the above please also include:\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Change log from the last version integrated (this should be a link to commits for easy verification and review): [example](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-mesos-modules/compare/f6fa27d7c40f4207ba3bb2274e2cfe79b62a395a...6660b90fbbf69a15ef46d0184e36755881d6a5ae)\r\n  - [ ] Test Results: [link to CI job test results for component]\r\n  - [ ] Code Coverage (if available): [link to code coverage report]\r\n___\r\n**PLEASE FILL IN THE TEMPLATE ABOVE** / **DO NOT REMOVE ANY SECTIONS ABOVE THIS LINE**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Instructions and review process\r\n\r\n**What is the review process and when will my changes land?**\r\n\r\nAll PRs require 2 approvals using GitHub's [pull request reviews](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/).\r\n\r\nReviewers should be:\r\n* Developers who understand the code being modified.\r\n* Developers responsible for code that interacts with or depends on the code being modified.\r\n\r\nIt is best to proactively ask for 2 reviews by @mentioning the candidate reviewers in the PR comments area. The responsibility is on the developer submitting the PR to follow-up with reviewers and make sure a PR is reviewed in a timely manner. Once a PR has **2 ship-it's**, **no red reviews**, and **all tests are green** it will be included in the [next train](https://github.com/dcos/dcos/blob/master/contributing.md).\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dcos/dcos/issues/comments/429674503","html_url":"https://github.com/dcos/dcos/pull/3547#issuecomment-429674503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dcos/dcos/issues/3547","id":429674503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTY3NDUwMw==","user":{"login":"mesosphere-mergebot","id":22822961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODIyOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22822961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot","html_url":"https://github.com/mesosphere-mergebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mesosphere-mergebot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:03Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":":wave: This PR has been inactive for 3 days.

Problem is, once installed, they do nothing. The theme does not show up in the theme selector menu.\r\n\r\n\"Theme\" shows up in the 3DS data management pane; 25 blocks, nothing wrong here. They show up in both DevMenu and FBI (neither of which give any errors when installing them.) This for both my spare 3DS, and the one it was purchased on (though I wouldn't expect that to make a difference, but I had to try just to be sure.)\r\n\r\nIf it matters, the theme in question is No. 133 - Eevee Collection: Espeon & Umbreon, for US region. I have no other themes purchased nor downloaded + it's all clean and straight off the theme shop.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I try to Verify file on the tmd, I get a \"Verification failed\" error, for both. The content app themselves get Verification success. If that might be of any help.\r\n\r\nFor sure, I could just install the theme with a homebrew theme manager, but I'd rather keep it looking as legit/retail as possible, and besides, if there's an issue with how GM9 dumps theme CIAs it's worth looking into anyway.\r\nI could be doing something wrong, but the process for dumping DLC to CIA and installing CIAs is so simple, there's not much I can possibly be screwing up, can there?"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d0k3/GodMode9/issues/comments/429674541","html_url":"https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/issues/438#issuecomment-429674541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d0k3/GodMode9/issues/438","id":429674541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTY3NDU0MQ==","user":{"login":"d0k3","id":12467483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDY3NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12467483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3","html_url":"https://github.com/d0k3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d0k3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I guess I'll need to have a more thorough look. @Ammako - can you contact me elsewhere?

But when the console was cancelled, WARP Inc reworked the game for the SEGA Dreamcast.\r\n\r\nKenji Eno, the founder of WARP and the creator of D, was so angry with Sony for not meeting the pre-order demands for the PS1 port of D he announced at the Sony conference that his next game, Enemy Zero, would become a SEGA Saturn exclusive.\r\n\r\nWhen D was originally released for the 3DO in Japan, Kenji Eno had a little problem getting the game to the US because of the violence and cannibalism seen in the game. His workaround was that he would make a \"clean\" version of the game so he could get the game approved by the rating board and censors, earning it a Teen rating from the ESRB. On the way to the production plant to make the game copies, he switched the \"clean\" version with the version he intended to use, thus he put a loophole to his advantage.\r\n\r\nD2 Shock demo has a special save that unlocks a secret movie in the full version of the Japanese release, accessible in the main menu. The \"secret movie\" was actually footage of the scrapped M2 version of D2. That clip can also seen in during the opening scene as an in-flight movie.\r\n\r\nIn the cancelled M2 version of D2, players would have taken the role of Laura's son in the medieval times.\r\n\r\nAlthough D, D2 and Enemy Zero are unrelated to each other story-wise, they share one noticable thing: the main character, Laura, appears in all three games, just with different surnames. Kenji Eno described Laura as a \"digital actress.\"\r\n\r\nDriv3r was infamous for the \"Driv3rgate\" scandal, where Infogrames (AKA Atari SA) gave PSM2 and Xbox World exclusivity and early access in exchange for stellar reviews. PSM2 and Xbox World both gave it 9/10's while other publications gave it more realistic 3/10's or 4/10's.\r\n\r\nSkweek for the Amstrad CPC was recalled because it was discovered that every time you finish the level, Skweek would tell the player to f*** their mother.\r\n\r\nThe Lion King was insanely hard because Disney didn't want people to rent the game than actually buy it upfront, so Westwood, the developer, made it super hard.\r\n\r\nThe bad quality of Fantasia for the Genesis and its following recall and controversy surrounding the fact that SEGA didn't get permission to make a game based on the film (yet Infogrames made the game anyway) was often presumed to be the main reason why Disney founded the now-defunct Disney Interactive in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere was originally an improved PS1 version of the infamous Superman 64, but it was cancelled because Titus realised they spent such a long time making the game, their license with DC Comics and Warner Bros. expired."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:41Z","org":{"id":5411318,"login":"RetroAchievements","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/RetroAchievements","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411318?"}}

Such a column is mapped to a nullable bool property to allow a difference between setting the property to false and invoking the default constraint.\r\n\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/comments/429674567","html_url":"https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/13613#issuecomment-429674567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/13613","id":429674567,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTY3NDU2Nw==","user":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:49Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@christopher-landress Consider this entity type:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class Foo\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get ;set; }\r\n    public bool IsValid { get ;set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere IsValid has a column default of `true` and this is mapped correctly int the EF model.\r\n\r\nAfter inserting the the following entity instance, what would you expect the IsValid column value to be set to?\r\n```C#\r\ncontext.Add(new Foo { IsValid = false });\r\ncontext.SaveChanges();\r\n```\r\nLikewise, for this:\r\n```C#\r\ncontext.Add(new Foo { IsValid = true });\r\ncontext.SaveChanges();\r\n```\r\nAnd for this one:\r\n```C#\r\ncontext.Add(new Foo());\r\ncontext.SaveChanges();\r\n```\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-15T00:00:49Z","org":{"id":6476660,"login":"aspnet","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/aspnet","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6476660?"}}
