The former one handles `IllegalArgumentException` only and returns `NULL` for invalid interval strings. This will allow to support interval strings without the `interval` prefix in casting strings to intervals and in interval type constructor because they use `fromString()` for parsing string intervals.\n\nFor example:\n```sql\nspark-sql> select cast('1 year 10 days' as interval);\ninterval 1 years 1 weeks 3 days\nspark-sql> SELECT INTERVAL '1 YEAR 10 DAYS';\ninterval 1 years 1 weeks 3 days\n```\n\n### Why are the changes needed?\nTo maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which supports interval strings without prefix:\n```sql\n# select interval '2 months 1 microsecond';\n        interval\n------------------------\n 2 mons 00:00:00.000001\n```\nand to improve Spark SQL UX.\n\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\nYes, previously parsing of interval strings without `interval` gives `NULL`:\n```sql\nspark-sql> select interval '2 months 1 microsecond';\nNULL\n```\nAfter:\n```sql\nspark-sql> select interval '2 months 1 microsecond';\ninterval 2 months 1 microseconds\n```\n\n### How was this patch tested?\n- Added new tests to `CalendarIntervalSuite.java`\n- A test for casting strings to intervals in `CastSuite`\n- Test for interval type constructor from strings in `ExpressionParserSuite`\n\nCloses #26079 from MaxGekk/interval-str-without-prefix.\n\nAuthored-by: Maxim Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/htynkn/spark/commits/da576a737c2db01e5ba5ce19ed0e8f900cb5efaf"},{"sha":"cfcaf528cdb5cb7c60a2fe06a4b35d7c10ec7b3e","author":{"name":"Huaxin Gao","email":"b1011540267ee7fe5a02243ad09c007ca1860809@us.ibm.com"},"message":"[SPARK-29381][PYTHON][ML] Add _ before the XXXParams classes\n\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\nAdd _ before XXXParams classes to indicate internal usage\n\n### Why are the changes needed?\nFollow the PEP 8 convention to use _single_leading_underscore to indicate internal use\n\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\nNo\n\n### How was this patch tested?\nuse existing tests\n\nCloses #26103 from huaxingao/spark-29381.\n\nAuthored-by: Huaxin Gao <huaxing@us.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Sean Owen <sean.owen@databricks.com>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/htynkn/spark/commits/cfcaf528cdb5cb7c60a2fe06a4b35d7c10ec7b3e"},{"sha":"ba0456223482b13540fbe62bb212bb9be50619be","author":{"name":"sandeep katta","email":"de35b570509e25e8ba02f4567be5670d9fd6bfbb@gmail.com"},"message":"[SPARK-29435][CORE] MapId in Shuffle Block is inconsistent at the writer and reader part when spark.shuffle.useOldFetchProtocol=true\n\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\nShuffle Block Construction during Shuffle Write and Read is wrong\n\nShuffle Map Task  (Shuffle Write)\n19/10/11 22:07:32| ERROR| [Executor task launch worker for task 3] org.apache.spark.shuffle.IndexShuffleBlockResolver: ####### For Debug ############ /tmp/hadoop-root1/nm-local-dir/usercache/root1/appcache/application_1570422377362_0008/blockmgr-6d03250d-6e7c-4bc2-bbb7-22b8e3981c35/0d/**shuffle_0_3_0.index**\n\nResult Task (Shuffle Read)\n19/10/11 22:07:32| ERROR| [Executor task launch worker for task 6] org.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Error occurred while fetching local blocks\njava.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /tmp/hadoop-root1/nm-local-dir/usercache/root1/appcache/application_1570422377362_0008/blockmgr-6d03250d-6e7c-4bc2-bbb7-22b8e3981c35/30/**shuffle_0_0_0.index**\n\tat sun.nio.fs.UnixException.translateToIOException(UnixException.java:86)\n\nAs per [SPARK-25341](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25341) `mapId` of `SortShuffleManager.getWriter `changed to `context.taskAttemptId() ` from `partitionId`\n\n[code]( https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25620/files#diff-363c53ca5a72cfdc37dac4a723309638R54)\n\nBut `MapOutputTracker.convertMapStatuses` returns the wrong ShuffleBlock, if `spark.shuffle.useOldFetchProtocol `enabled, it returns `paritionId` as `mapID` which is wrong .

I have considered adding that for microcontrollers with enough heap memory.\r\n\r\nIf I understand you correctly, it sounds like your 60ms or 30s is measured according to how long the coroutine was \"active\", instead of being measure according to the \"wall clock\"? AceRoutine does not support the \"active clock\" concept. The library simply uses the built-in `millis()` and `micros()` methods provided by the Arduino framework, and it's not clear to me how to create a per-coroutine clock that ticks *only* when the coroutine is \"active\". (It would definitely take additional varables in the `Coroutine` class, and additional logic during context switching, and I'm not sure if it would actually work.)\r\n\r\nThe `timeScale` idea is very interesting. Though I'm not sure that it would help in this case. Seems like the problem is distinguishing between a coroutine's \"active\" time versus \"suspended\" time.\r\n\r\nWhat is the accuracy that you need for your coroutine \"active clock\"? Can it have roughly a one-second accuracy? If so, instead of using `COROUTINE_DELAY_SECONDS()`, maybe you can use an explicit loop, and count the \"active time\" manually?\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nstatic uint16_t activeClock;\r\nfor (activeClock = 0; activeClock < 30; activeClock++) {\r\n  COROUTINE_DELAY(1000);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use a macro to avoid repetition:\r\n```C++\r\n#define DELAY_ACTIVE_SECONDS(delay) \\\r\n  for (activeClock=0; activeClock < delay; activeClock++) { \\\r\n  COROUTINE_DELAY(1000); \\\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you create your own `Coroutine` subclass, you would create `activeClock` as a `private` member variable of your subclass.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:07Z"}

We shouldn't make assumption about how API clients will use this library and therefore leave it up to them to decide whether they want to retain a singleton copy of `VimeoClient` or not.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Summary\r\n\r\n* Removes convenience `shared` initializer and configure method\r\n* Fixes all unit tests that were making use of the shared singleton in favor of a local client instance.\r\n* Creates a `VimeoClient` factory inside the testing target for convenience\r\n* Removes unused bridging header file from test target\r\n\r\n#### How to Test\r\n\r\n* Build and run, ensure all tests pass\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:11Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:11Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/VimeoNetworking/pulls/370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/VimeoNetworking/pulls/370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/VimeoNetworking/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/VimeoNetworking/issues/370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/VimeoNetworking/statuses/ee921d2b0529e437d6480deaa598b8be519cf1bc","head":{"label":"vimeo:VIM-XXXX_RemovesSharedClient","ref":"VIM-XXXX_RemovesSharedClient","sha":"ee921d2b0529e437d6480deaa598b8be519cf1bc","user":{"login":"vimeo","id":317769,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxNzc2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/317769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53346603,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzM0NjYwMw==","name":"VimeoNetworking","full_name":"vimeo/VimeoNetworking","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vimeo","id":317769,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxNzc2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/317769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vimeo/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/VimeoNetworking","description":"The

They instead use a package name as identifier. We should show them instead.\n- each apk also runs under a different user. That's how android works\n- because of the user permission, some files like /proc/<pid>/{environ,exe} can't be read.\n\nThis results in a very small process list.\n\nThis is a local run on my machine\n```\n(lldb) platform process list\n2 matching processes were found on \"remote-android\"\nPID    PARENT USER       TRIPLE                   NAME\n====== ====== ========== ======================== ============================\n23291  3177              aarch64-unknown-linux-android sh\n23301  23291            aarch64-unknown-linux-android lldb-server\n```\nHowever, I have 700 processes running at this time.\n\nBy implementing a few fallbacks for android, I've expanded this list to 202, filtering out kernel processes, which would presumably appear in this list if the device was rooted.\n\n```\n(lldb) platform process list\n202 matching processes were found on \"remote-android\"\nPID    PARENT USER       TRIPLE                   NAME\n====== ====== ========== ======================== ============================\n...\n12647  3208              aarch64-unknown-linux-android sh\n12649  12647             aarch64-unknown-linux-android lldb-server\n12653  982                                        com.samsung.faceservice\n13185  982                                        com.samsung.vvm\n15899  982                                        com.samsung.android.spay\n16220  982                                        com.sec.spp.push\n17126  982                                        com.sec.spp.push:RemoteDlcProcess\n19772  983                                        com.android.chrome\n20209  982                                        com.samsung.cmh:CMH\n20380  982                                        com.google.android.inputmethod.latin\n20879  982                                        com.samsung.android.oneconnect:Receiver\n21212  983                                        com.tencent.mm\n24459  1                 aarch64-unknown-linux-android wpa_supplicant\n25974  982                                        com.samsung.android.contacts\n26293  982                                        com.samsung.android.messaging\n28714  982                                        com.samsung.android.dialer\n31605  982                                        com.samsung.android.MtpApplication\n32256  982                                        com.bezobidny\n```\n\nSomething to notice is that the architecture is unkonwn for all apks. And that's fine, because run-as would be required to gather this information and that would make this entire functionality massively slow.\n\nThere are still several improvements to make here, like displaying actual user names, which I'll try to do in a following diff.\n\nNote: Regarding overall apk debugging support from lldb. I'm planning on having lldb spawn lldb-server by itself with the correct user, so that everything works well. The initial lldb-server used for connecting to the remote platform can be reused for such purpose. Furthermore, eventually lldb could also launch that initial lldb-server on its own.\n\nDifferential Revision: D68289\n\nllvm-svn: 374853","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClangBuiltLinux/llvm-project/commits/d04855f820c5f21c2ae95e711bf003af575e58e3"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:12Z","org":{"id":37553356,"login":"ClangBuiltLinux","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/ClangBuiltLinux","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553356?"}}

The idea behind the PR is that we have no idea what future architectures might bring, and that having to do all the crazy tuning that we do and make the compromises that we make might be incredibly expensive in terms of human hours and sanity. It would be nice if we could instead declare our tuning parameters, and then tune them until they are good.\r\n\r\nThis aims to give us an interface in which we declare tuning variables and expose them to Tools via hooks, much like our Profiling hooks. This stab at the problem has two main pieces: Tuning Variables and Context Variables (\"Thing to learn via ML\" and \"Features for ML algorithms to eat\" respectively).\r\n\r\nFirst, the existence of such a Variable is declared. Each variable has\r\n\r\n1. a name\r\n2. a unique id\r\n3. a value type (boolean, int, float, text/char*)\r\n4. a value category (categorical, ordinal, interval, ratio)\r\n5. a descriptor of the candidate values (are they a set or a range)\r\n6. The actual candidate values\r\n\r\nNote that these are not independent, a boolean is not going to be interval data. Then, we can declare the values of context variables, or request the values of tuning variables. My hope is that the declaration of context variables might leak out into codes, so we don't just learn block size from kernel name and bounds, but from \"number of particles\" or \"mesh refinement.\"\r\n\r\nThis is still very much a WIP, but I wanted to discuss\r\n\r\n1. Code organization. I think we no longer just have Kokkos_Profiling_Interface.hpp, we might now have Kokkos_Tools_Interface, which includes Kokkos_Tuning_Interface, Kokkos_Profiling_Interface, Kokkos_Debugging_Interface (once I get around to writing it), but I want people's views\r\n2. Is this approach utterly \"set it on fire\" wrong? Mildly wrong? In each case, how can we make it even more wrong? (edit: @crtrott apparently wants code that is less wrong)\r\n3. If not, what should be tuning variables in an initial draft? So far Christian has told me block size (Ye Auld Autotuning Parameter) and whether to store functors in constant memory\r\n\r\nI'll probably be taking a true swing at this next week, but I wanted this to marinade somebody's brain over the weekend so they'd tell me what needs to happen here.","created_at":"2019-10-04T21:10:26Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:15Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7c51a306f5399bd1488c4aaba59a8cfe181fced","assignee":{"login":"DavidPoliakoff","id":4220361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4220361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidPoliakoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"DavidPoliakoff","id":4220361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4220361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidPoliakoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":875303895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NzUzMDM4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kokkos/kokkos/labels/[WIP]","name":"[WIP]","color":"e8882e","default":false}],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kokkos/kokkos/pulls/2422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kokkos/kokkos/pulls/2422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kokkos/kokkos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kokkos/kokkos/issues/2422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kokkos/kokkos/statuses/6bf74ae93e259fa36576332baaca4a29325e47f1","head":{"label":"DavidPoliakoff:feature/tuning","ref":"feature/tuning","sha":"6bf74ae93e259fa36576332baaca4a29325e47f1","user":{"login":"DavidPoliakoff","id":4220361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4220361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidPoliakoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141735391,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE3MzUzOTE=","name":"kokkos","full_name":"DavidPoliakoff/kokkos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DavidPoliakoff","id":4220361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4220361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidPoliakoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidPoliakoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com

Description\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this pull request is to update the implementation of the scroll headers for the containers `PlaylistView`, `LibrarySingleAlbumView`, and `UserProfileView`.\r\n\r\n#### Test Plan\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the scroll headers with help from `react-native-interactable` is just not cutting it when it comes to performance and usability. It certainly works, but the header will stick too much and we also lose the ability to refresh the lists of tracks. With this PR, we'll be refactoring the entire process overall to make it more usable and performant.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI've gone through the app and manually tested the functionality in all the containers where this was implemented to ensure the feature is performing as expected.\r\n\r\n### Types of Changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- ~~Bug fix~~\r\n- [x] New feature\r\n- ~~Breaking change~~\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project\r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tunerinc/brassroots/issues/comments/541979037","html_url":"https://github.com/tunerinc/brassroots/pull/56#issuecomment-541979037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tunerinc/brassroots/issues/56","id":541979037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTk3OTAzNw==","user":{"login":"therealaldo","id":9423837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MjM4Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9423837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo","html_url":"https://github.com/therealaldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/therealaldo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:16Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![](https://github.trello.services/images/mini-trello-icon.png) [Update scroll headers](https://trello.com/c/6K0banrv/317-update-scroll-headers)"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:16Z","org":{"id":32567765,"login":"tunerinc","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tunerinc","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32567765?"}}

(5237)\n- A crash when reinstalling from VCS requirements has been fixed. (5251)\n- Fix PEP 518 support when pip is installed in the user site. (5524)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.2.7\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 10.0.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Prevent false-positive installation warnings due to incomplete name\n  normalization. (5134)\n- Fix issue where installing from Git with a short SHA would fail. (5140)\n- Accept pre-release versions when checking for conflicts with pip check or pip\n  install.

(5131)\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 10.0.0b1\n   ```\n   =====================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Removed the deprecated ``--egg`` parameter to ``pip install``. (1749)\n- Removed support for uninstalling projects which have been installed using\n  distutils. distutils installed projects do not include metadata indicating\n  what files belong to that install and thus it is impossible to *actually*\n  uninstall them rather than just remove the metadata saying they&#39;ve been\n  installed while leaving all of the actual files behind. (2386)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--download`` option to ``pip install``. (2643)\n- Removed the deprecated --(no-)use-wheel flags to ``pip install`` and ``pip\n  wheel``. (2699)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and\n  ``--allow-unverified`` options. (3070)\n- Switch the default for ``pip list`` to the columns format, and deprecate the\n  legacy format. (3654, 3686)\n- Deprecate support for Python 3.3. (3796)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--default-vcs`` option. (4052)\n- Removed the ``setup.py test`` support from our sdist as it wasn&#39;t being\n  maintained as a supported means to run our tests. (4203)\n- Dropped support for Python 2.6. (4343)\n- Removed the --editable flag from pip download, as it did not make sense\n  (4362)\n- Deprecate SVN detection based on dependency links in ``pip freeze``. (4449)\n- Move all of pip&#39;s APIs into the pip._internal package, properly reflecting\n  the fact that pip does not currently have any public APIs. (4696, 4700)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add `--progress-bar &lt;progress_bar&gt;` to ``pip download``, ``pip install`` and\n  ``pip wheel`` commands, to allow selecting a specific progress indicator or,\n  to completely suppress, (for example in a CI environment) use\n  ``--progress-bar off. (2369, 2756)\n- Add `--no-color` to `pip`. All colored output is disabled if this flag is\n  detected. (2449)\n- pip uninstall now ignores the absence of a requirement and prints a warning.\n  (3016, 4642)\n- Improved the memory and disk efficiency of the HTTP cache. (3515)\n- Support for packages specifying build dependencies in pyproject.toml (see\n  `PEP 518 &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/&gt;`__). Packages which\n  specify one or more build dependencies this way will be built into wheels in\n  an isolated environment with those dependencies installed. (3691)\n- pip now supports environment variable expansion in requirement files using\n  only ``${VARIABLE}`` syntax on all platforms. (3728)\n- Allowed combinations of -q and -v to act sanely. Then we don&#39;t need warnings\n  mentioned in the issue. (4008)\n- Add `--exclude-editable` to ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` to exclude\n  editable packages from installed package list. (4015, 4016)\n- Improve the error message for the common ``pip install ./requirements.txt``\n  case. (4127)\n- Add support for the new `` url`` syntax from PEP 508. (4175)\n- Add setuptools version to the statistics sent to BigQuery. (4209)\n- Report the line which caused the hash error when using requirement files.\n  (4227)\n- Add a pip config command for managing configuration files. (4240)\n- Allow ``pip download`` to be used with a specific platform when ``--no-deps``\n  is set. (4289)\n- Support build-numbers in wheel versions and support sorting with\n  build-numbers. (4299)\n- Change pip outdated to use PackageFinder in order to do the version lookup so\n  that local mirrors in Environments that do not have Internet connections can\n  be used as the Source of Truth for latest version. (4336)\n- pip now retries on more HTTP status codes, for intermittent failures.\n  Previously, it only retried on the standard 503. Now, it also retries on 500\n  (transient failures on AWS S3), 520 and 527 (transient failures on\n  Cloudflare). (4473)\n- pip now displays where it is looking for packages, if non-default locations\n  are used. (4483)\n- Display a message to run the right command for modifying pip on Windows\n  (4490)\n- Add Man Pages for pip (4491)\n- Make uninstall command less verbose by default (4493)\n- Switch the default upgrade strategy to be &#39;only-if-needed&#39; (4500)\n- Installing from a local directory or a VCS URL now builds a wheel to install,\n  rather than running ``setup.py install``. Wheels from these sources are not\n  cached. (4501)\n- Don&#39;t log a warning when installing a dependency from Git if the name looks\n  like a commit hash. (4507)\n- pip now displays a warning when it installs scripts from a wheel outside the\n  PATH. These warnings can be suppressed using a new --no-warn-script-location\n  option. (4553)\n- Local Packages can now be referenced using forward slashes on Windows.\n  (4563)\n- pip show learnt a new Required-by field that lists currently installed\n  packages that depend on the shown package (4564)\n- The command-line autocompletion engine ``pip show`` now autocompletes\n  installed distribution names. (4749)\n- Change documentation theme to be in line with Python Documentation (4758)\n- Add auto completion of short options. (4954)\n- Run &#39;setup.py develop&#39; inside pep518 build environment. (4999)\n- pip install now prints an error message when it installs an incompatible\n  version of a dependency. (5000)\n- Added a way to distinguish between pip installed packages and those from the\n  system package manager in &#39;pip list&#39;. Specifically, &#39;pip list -v&#39; also shows\n  the installer of package if it has that meta data. (949)\n- Show install locations when list command ran with &quot;-v&quot; option. (979)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Allow pip to work if the ``GIT_DIR`` and ``GIT_WORK_TREE`` environment\n  variables are set. (1130)\n- Make ``pip install --force-reinstall`` not require passing ``--upgrade``.\n  (1139)\n- Return a failing exit status when `pip install`, `pip download`, or `pip\n  wheel` is called with no requirements. (2720)\n- Interactive setup.py files will no longer hang indefinitely. (2732, 4982)\n- Correctly reset the terminal if an exception occurs while a progress bar is\n  being shown. (3015)\n- &quot;Support URL-encoded characters in URL credentials.&quot; (3236)\n- Don&#39;t assume sys.__stderr__.encoding exists (3356)\n- Fix ``pip uninstall`` when ``easy-install.pth`` lacks a trailing newline.\n  (3741)\n- Keep install options in requirements.txt from leaking. (3763)\n- pip no longer passes global options from one package to later packages in the\n  same requirement file. (3830)\n- Support installing from Git refs (3876)\n- Use pkg_resources to parse the entry points file to allow names with colons.\n  (3901)\n- ``-q`` specified once correctly sets logging level to WARNING, instead of\n  CRITICAL. Use `-qqq` to have the previous behavior back. (3994)\n- Shell completion scripts now use correct executable names (e.g., ``pip3``\n  instead of ``pip``) (3997)\n- Changed vendored encodings from ``utf8`` to ``utf-8``. (4076)\n- Fixes destination directory of data_files when ``pip install --target`` is\n  used. (4092)\n- Limit the disabling of requests&#39; pyopenssl to Windows only. Fixes\n  &quot;SNIMissingWarning / InsecurePlatformWarning not fixable with pip 9.0 /\n  9.0.1&quot; (for non-Windows) (4098)\n- Support the installation of wheels with non-PEP 440 version in their\n  filenames. (4169)\n- Fall back to sys.getdefaultencoding() if locale.getpreferredencoding()\n  returns None in `pip.utils.encoding.auto_decode`. (4184)\n- Fix a bug where `SETUPTOOLS_SHIM` got called incorrectly for relative path\n  requirements by converting relative paths to absolute paths prior to calling\n  the shim. (4208)\n- Return the latest version number in search results. (4219)\n- Improve error message on permission errors (4233)\n- Fail gracefully when ``/etc/image_version`` (or another distro version file)\n  appears to exists but is not readable. (4249)\n- Avoid importing setuptools in the parent pip process, to avoid a race\n  condition when upgrading one of setuptools dependencies. (4264)\n- Fix for an incorrect ``freeze`` warning message due to a package being\n  included in multiple requirements files that were passed to ``freeze``.\n  Instead of warning incorrectly that the package is not installed, pip now\n  warns that the package was declared multiple times and lists the name of each\n  requirements file that contains the package in question. (4293)\n- Generalize help text for ``compile``/``no-compile`` flags. (4316)\n- Handle the case when ``/etc`` is not readable by the current user by using a\n  hardcoded list of possible names of release files. (4320)\n- Fixed a ``NameError`` when attempting to catch ``FileNotFoundError`` on\n  Python 2.7. (4322)\n- Ensure USER_SITE is correctly initialised. (4437)\n- Reinstalling an editable package from Git no longer assumes that the\n  ``master`` branch exists. (4448)\n- This fixes an issue where when someone who tries to use git with pip but pip\n  can&#39;t because git is not in the path environment variable. This clarifies the\n  error given to suggest to the user what might be wrong. (4461)\n- Improve handling of text output from build tools (avoid Unicode errors)\n  (4486)\n- Fix a &quot;No such file or directory&quot; error when using --prefix. (4495)\n- Allow commands to opt out of --require-venv. This allows pip help to work\n  even when the environment variable PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV is set. (4496)\n- Fix warning message on mismatched versions during installation. (4655)\n- pip now records installed files in a deterministic manner improving\n  reproducibility. (4667)\n- Fix an issue where ``pip install -e`` on a Git url would fail to update if a\n  branch or tag name is specified that happens to match the prefix of the\n  current ``HEAD`` commit hash. (4675)\n- Fix an issue where a variable assigned in a try clause was accessed in the\n  except clause, resulting in an undefined variable error in the except clause.\n  (4811)\n- Use log level `info` instead of `warning` when ignoring packages due to\n  environment markers. (4876)\n- Replaced typo mistake in subversion support. (4908)\n- Terminal size is now correctly inferred when using Python 3 on Windows.\n  (4966)\n- Abort if reading configuration causes encoding errors. (4976)\n- Add a ``--no-user`` option and use it when installing build dependencies.\n  (5085)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgraded appdirs to 1.4.3.\n- Upgraded CacheControl to 0.12.3.\n- Vendored certifi at 2017.7.27.1.\n- Vendored chardet at 3.0.4.\n- Upgraded colorama to 0.3.9.\n- Upgraded distlib to 0.2.6.\n- Upgraded distro to 1.2.0.\n- Vendored idna at idna==2.6.\n- Upgraded ipaddress to 1.0.18.\n- Vendored msgpack-python at 0.4.8.\n- Removed the vendored ordereddict.\n- Upgraded progress to 1.3.\n- Upgraded pyparsing to 2.2.0.\n- Upgraded pytoml to 0.1.14.\n- Upgraded requests to 2.18.4.\n- Upgraded pkg_resources (via setuptools) to 36.6.0.\n- Upgraded six to 1.11.0.\n- Vendored urllib3 at 1.22.\n- Upgraded webencodings to 0.5.1.\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Added documentation on usage of --build command line option (4262)\n-  (4358)\n- Document how to call pip from your code, including the fact that we do not\n  provide a Python API.

(3651, 3654)\n- Dropped support for Python 3.3. (3796)\n- Remove support for cleaning up egg fragment postfixes. (4174)\n- Remove the shim for the old get-pip.py location. (5520)\n\n  For the past 2 years, it&#39;s only been redirecting users to use the newer\n  https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py location.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Introduce a new --prefer-binary flag, to prefer older wheels over newer source packages. (3785)\n- Improve autocompletion function on file name completion after options\n  which have ``&lt;file&gt;``, ``&lt;dir&gt;`` or ``&lt;path&gt;`` as metavar. (4842, 5125)\n- Add support for installing PEP 518 build dependencies from source. (5229)\n- Improve status message when upgrade is skipped due to only-if-needed strategy. (5319)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Update pip&#39;s self-check logic to not use a virtualenv specific file and honor cache-dir. (3905)\n- Remove compiled pyo files for wheel packages. (4471)\n- Speed up printing of newly installed package versions. (5127)\n- Restrict install time dependency warnings to directly-dependant packages.

(5346)\n\n  This works better with Linux distributions where pip&#39;s upgrade message may\n  result in users running pip in a manner that modifies files that should be\n  managed by the OS&#39;s package manager.\n- Check for file existence and unlink first when clobbering existing files during a wheel install. (5366)\n- Improve error message to be more specific when no files are found as listed in as listed in PKG-INFO. (5381)\n- Always read ``pyproject.toml`` as UTF-8.

(5131)\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 10.0.0b1\n   ```\n   =====================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Removed the deprecated ``--egg`` parameter to ``pip install``. (1749)\n- Removed support for uninstalling projects which have been installed using\n  distutils. distutils installed projects do not include metadata indicating\n  what files belong to that install and thus it is impossible to *actually*\n  uninstall them rather than just remove the metadata saying they&#39;ve been\n  installed while leaving all of the actual files behind. (2386)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--download`` option to ``pip install``. (2643)\n- Removed the deprecated --(no-)use-wheel flags to ``pip install`` and ``pip\n  wheel``. (2699)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and\n  ``--allow-unverified`` options. (3070)\n- Switch the default for ``pip list`` to the columns format, and deprecate the\n  legacy format. (3654, 3686)\n- Deprecate support for Python 3.3.

(4203)\n- Dropped support for Python 2.6. (4343)\n- Removed the --editable flag from pip download, as it did not make sense\n  (4362)\n- Deprecate SVN detection based on dependency links in ``pip freeze``. (4449)\n- Move all of pip&#39;s APIs into the pip._internal package, properly reflecting\n  the fact that pip does not currently have any public APIs. (4696, 4700)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add `--progress-bar &lt;progress_bar&gt;` to ``pip download``, ``pip install`` and\n  ``pip wheel`` commands, to allow selecting a specific progress indicator or,\n  to completely suppress, (for example in a CI environment) use\n  ``--progress-bar off. (2369, 2756)\n- Add `--no-color` to `pip`. All colored output is disabled if this flag is\n  detected. (2449)\n- pip uninstall now ignores the absence of a requirement and prints a warning.\n  (3016, 4642)\n- Improved the memory and disk efficiency of the HTTP cache. (3515)\n- Support for packages specifying build dependencies in pyproject.toml (see\n  `PEP 518 &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/&gt;`__). Packages which\n  specify one or more build dependencies this way will be built into wheels in\n  an isolated environment with those dependencies installed. (3691)\n- pip now supports environment variable expansion in requirement files using\n  only ``${VARIABLE}`` syntax on all platforms. (3728)\n- Allowed combinations of -q and -v to act sanely. Then we don&#39;t need warnings\n  mentioned in the issue. (4008)\n- Add `--exclude-editable` to ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` to exclude\n  editable packages from installed package list. (4015, 4016)\n- Improve the error message for the common ``pip install ./requirements.txt``\n  case. (4127)\n- Add support for the new `` url`` syntax from PEP 508. (4175)\n- Add setuptools version to the statistics sent to BigQuery. (4209)\n- Report the line which caused the hash error when using requirement files.\n  (4227)\n- Add a pip config command for managing configuration files. (4240)\n- Allow ``pip download`` to be used with a specific platform when ``--no-deps``\n  is set. (4289)\n- Support build-numbers in wheel versions and support sorting with\n  build-numbers. (4299)\n- Change pip outdated to use PackageFinder in order to do the version lookup so\n  that local mirrors in Environments that do not have Internet connections can\n  be used as the Source of Truth for latest version. (4336)\n- pip now retries on more HTTP status codes, for intermittent failures.\n  Previously, it only retried on the standard 503. Now, it also retries on 500\n  (transient failures on AWS S3), 520 and 527 (transient failures on\n  Cloudflare). (4473)\n- pip now displays where it is looking for packages, if non-default locations\n  are used. (4483)\n- Display a message to run the right command for modifying pip on Windows\n  (4490)\n- Add Man Pages for pip (4491)\n- Make uninstall command less verbose by default (4493)\n- Switch the default upgrade strategy to be &#39;only-if-needed&#39; (4500)\n- Installing from a local directory or a VCS URL now builds a wheel to install,\n  rather than running ``setup.py install``. Wheels from these sources are not\n  cached. (4501)\n- Don&#39;t log a warning when installing a dependency from Git if the name looks\n  like a commit hash. (4507)\n- pip now displays a warning when it installs scripts from a wheel outside the\n  PATH. These warnings can be suppressed using a new --no-warn-script-location\n  option. (4553)\n- Local Packages can now be referenced using forward slashes on Windows.\n  (4563)\n- pip show learnt a new Required-by field that lists currently installed\n  packages that depend on the shown package (4564)\n- The command-line autocompletion engine ``pip show`` now autocompletes\n  installed distribution names. (4749)\n- Change documentation theme to be in line with Python Documentation (4758)\n- Add auto completion of short options. (4954)\n- Run &#39;setup.py develop&#39; inside pep518 build environment. (4999)\n- pip install now prints an error message when it installs an incompatible\n  version of a dependency. (5000)\n- Added a way to distinguish between pip installed packages and those from the\n  system package manager in &#39;pip list&#39;. Specifically, &#39;pip list -v&#39; also shows\n  the installer of package if it has that meta data. (949)\n- Show install locations when list command ran with &quot;-v&quot; option. (979)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Allow pip to work if the ``GIT_DIR`` and ``GIT_WORK_TREE`` environment\n  variables are set. (1130)\n- Make ``pip install --force-reinstall`` not require passing ``--upgrade``.\n  (1139)\n- Return a failing exit status when `pip install`, `pip download`, or `pip\n  wheel` is called with no requirements. (2720)\n- Interactive setup.py files will no longer hang indefinitely. (2732, 4982)\n- Correctly reset the terminal if an exception occurs while a progress bar is\n  being shown. (3015)\n- &quot;Support URL-encoded characters in URL credentials.&quot; (3236)\n- Don&#39;t assume sys.__stderr__.encoding exists (3356)\n- Fix ``pip uninstall`` when ``easy-install.pth`` lacks a trailing newline.\n  (3741)\n- Keep install options in requirements.txt from leaking. (3763)\n- pip no longer passes global options from one package to later packages in the\n  same requirement file. (3830)\n- Support installing from Git refs (3876)\n- Use pkg_resources to parse the entry points file to allow names with colons.\n  (3901)\n- ``-q`` specified once correctly sets logging level to WARNING, instead of\n  CRITICAL. Use `-qqq` to have the previous behavior back. (3994)\n- Shell completion scripts now use correct executable names (e.g., ``pip3``\n  instead of ``pip``) (3997)\n- Changed vendored encodings from ``utf8`` to ``utf-8``. (4076)\n- Fixes destination directory of data_files when ``pip install --target`` is\n  used. (4092)\n- Limit the disabling of requests&#39; pyopenssl to Windows only. Fixes\n  &quot;SNIMissingWarning / InsecurePlatformWarning not fixable with pip 9.0 /\n  9.0.1&quot; (for non-Windows) (4098)\n- Support the installation of wheels with non-PEP 440 version in their\n  filenames. (4169)\n- Fall back to sys.getdefaultencoding() if locale.getpreferredencoding()\n  returns None in `pip.utils.encoding.auto_decode`. (4184)\n- Fix a bug where `SETUPTOOLS_SHIM` got called incorrectly for relative path\n  requirements by converting relative paths to absolute paths prior to calling\n  the shim. (4208)\n- Return the latest version number in search results. (4219)\n- Improve error message on permission errors (4233)\n- Fail gracefully when ``/etc/image_version`` (or another distro version file)\n  appears to exists but is not readable. (4249)\n- Avoid importing setuptools in the parent pip process, to avoid a race\n  condition when upgrading one of setuptools dependencies. (4264)\n- Fix for an incorrect ``freeze`` warning message due to a package being\n  included in multiple requirements files that were passed to ``freeze``.\n  Instead of warning incorrectly that the package is not installed, pip now\n  warns that the package was declared multiple times and lists the name of each\n  requirements file that contains the package in question. (4293)\n- Generalize help text for ``compile``/``no-compile`` flags. (4316)\n- Handle the case when ``/etc`` is not readable by the current user by using a\n  hardcoded list of possible names of release files. (4320)\n- Fixed a ``NameError`` when attempting to catch ``FileNotFoundError`` on\n  Python 2.7. (4322)\n- Ensure USER_SITE is correctly initialised. (4437)\n- Reinstalling an editable package from Git no longer assumes that the\n  ``master`` branch exists. (4448)\n- This fixes an issue where when someone who tries to use git with pip but pip\n  can&#39;t because git is not in the path environment variable. This clarifies the\n  error given to suggest to the user what might be wrong. (4461)\n- Improve handling of text output from build tools (avoid Unicode errors)\n  (4486)\n- Fix a &quot;No such file or directory&quot; error when using --prefix. (4495)\n- Allow commands to opt out of --require-venv. This allows pip help to work\n  even when the environment variable PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV is set. (4496)\n- Fix warning message on mismatched versions during installation. (4655)\n- pip now records installed files in a deterministic manner improving\n  reproducibility. (4667)\n- Fix an issue where ``pip install -e`` on a Git url would fail to update if a\n  branch or tag name is specified that happens to match the prefix of the\n  current ``HEAD`` commit hash. (4675)\n- Fix an issue where a variable assigned in a try clause was accessed in the\n  except clause, resulting in an undefined variable error in the except clause.\n  (4811)\n- Use log level `info` instead of `warning` when ignoring packages due to\n  environment markers. (4876)\n- Replaced typo mistake in subversion support.

(5346)\n\n  This works better with Linux distributions where pip&#39;s upgrade message may\n  result in users running pip in a manner that modifies files that should be\n  managed by the OS&#39;s package manager.\n- Check for file existence and unlink first when clobbering existing files during a wheel install. (5366)\n- Improve error message to be more specific when no files are found as listed in as listed in PKG-INFO. (5381)\n- Always read ``pyproject.toml`` as UTF-8.

(5131)\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 10.0.0b1\n   ```\n   =====================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Removed the deprecated ``--egg`` parameter to ``pip install``. (1749)\n- Removed support for uninstalling projects which have been installed using\n  distutils. distutils installed projects do not include metadata indicating\n  what files belong to that install and thus it is impossible to *actually*\n  uninstall them rather than just remove the metadata saying they&#39;ve been\n  installed while leaving all of the actual files behind. (2386)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--download`` option to ``pip install``. (2643)\n- Removed the deprecated --(no-)use-wheel flags to ``pip install`` and ``pip\n  wheel``. (2699)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and\n  ``--allow-unverified`` options. (3070)\n- Switch the default for ``pip list`` to the columns format, and deprecate the\n  legacy format. (3654, 3686)\n- Deprecate support for Python 3.3.

(4203)\n- Dropped support for Python 2.6. (4343)\n- Removed the --editable flag from pip download, as it did not make sense\n  (4362)\n- Deprecate SVN detection based on dependency links in ``pip freeze``. (4449)\n- Move all of pip&#39;s APIs into the pip._internal package, properly reflecting\n  the fact that pip does not currently have any public APIs. (4696, 4700)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add `--progress-bar &lt;progress_bar&gt;` to ``pip download``, ``pip install`` and\n  ``pip wheel`` commands, to allow selecting a specific progress indicator or,\n  to completely suppress, (for example in a CI environment) use\n  ``--progress-bar off. (2369, 2756)\n- Add `--no-color` to `pip`. All colored output is disabled if this flag is\n  detected. (2449)\n- pip uninstall now ignores the absence of a requirement and prints a warning.\n  (3016, 4642)\n- Improved the memory and disk efficiency of the HTTP cache. (3515)\n- Support for packages specifying build dependencies in pyproject.toml (see\n  `PEP 518 &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/&gt;`__). Packages which\n  specify one or more build dependencies this way will be built into wheels in\n  an isolated environment with those dependencies installed. (3691)\n- pip now supports environment variable expansion in requirement files using\n  only ``${VARIABLE}`` syntax on all platforms. (3728)\n- Allowed combinations of -q and -v to act sanely. Then we don&#39;t need warnings\n  mentioned in the issue. (4008)\n- Add `--exclude-editable` to ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` to exclude\n  editable packages from installed package list. (4015, 4016)\n- Improve the error message for the common ``pip install ./requirements.txt``\n  case. (4127)\n- Add support for the new `` url`` syntax from PEP 508. (4175)\n- Add setuptools version to the statistics sent to BigQuery. (4209)\n- Report the line which caused the hash error when using requirement files.\n  (4227)\n- Add a pip config command for managing configuration files. (4240)\n- Allow ``pip download`` to be used with a specific platform when ``--no-deps``\n  is set. (4289)\n- Support build-numbers in wheel versions and support sorting with\n  build-numbers. (4299)\n- Change pip outdated to use PackageFinder in order to do the version lookup so\n  that local mirrors in Environments that do not have Internet connections can\n  be used as the Source of Truth for latest version. (4336)\n- pip now retries on more HTTP status codes, for intermittent failures.\n  Previously, it only retried on the standard 503. Now, it also retries on 500\n  (transient failures on AWS S3), 520 and 527 (transient failures on\n  Cloudflare). (4473)\n- pip now displays where it is looking for packages, if non-default locations\n  are used. (4483)\n- Display a message to run the right command for modifying pip on Windows\n  (4490)\n- Add Man Pages for pip (4491)\n- Make uninstall command less verbose by default (4493)\n- Switch the default upgrade strategy to be &#39;only-if-needed&#39; (4500)\n- Installing from a local directory or a VCS URL now builds a wheel to install,\n  rather than running ``setup.py install``. Wheels from these sources are not\n  cached. (4501)\n- Don&#39;t log a warning when installing a dependency from Git if the name looks\n  like a commit hash. (4507)\n- pip now displays a warning when it installs scripts from a wheel outside the\n  PATH. These warnings can be suppressed using a new --no-warn-script-location\n  option. (4553)\n- Local Packages can now be referenced using forward slashes on Windows.\n  (4563)\n- pip show learnt a new Required-by field that lists currently installed\n  packages that depend on the shown package (4564)\n- The command-line autocompletion engine ``pip show`` now autocompletes\n  installed distribution names. (4749)\n- Change documentation theme to be in line with Python Documentation (4758)\n- Add auto completion of short options. (4954)\n- Run &#39;setup.py develop&#39; inside pep518 build environment. (4999)\n- pip install now prints an error message when it installs an incompatible\n  version of a dependency. (5000)\n- Added a way to distinguish between pip installed packages and those from the\n  system package manager in &#39;pip list&#39;. Specifically, &#39;pip list -v&#39; also shows\n  the installer of package if it has that meta data. (949)\n- Show install locations when list command ran with &quot;-v&quot; option. (979)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Allow pip to work if the ``GIT_DIR`` and ``GIT_WORK_TREE`` environment\n  variables are set. (1130)\n- Make ``pip install --force-reinstall`` not require passing ``--upgrade``.\n  (1139)\n- Return a failing exit status when `pip install`, `pip download`, or `pip\n  wheel` is called with no requirements. (2720)\n- Interactive setup.py files will no longer hang indefinitely. (2732, 4982)\n- Correctly reset the terminal if an exception occurs while a progress bar is\n  being shown. (3015)\n- &quot;Support URL-encoded characters in URL credentials.&quot; (3236)\n- Don&#39;t assume sys.__stderr__.encoding exists (3356)\n- Fix ``pip uninstall`` when ``easy-install.pth`` lacks a trailing newline.\n  (3741)\n- Keep install options in requirements.txt from leaking. (3763)\n- pip no longer passes global options from one package to later packages in the\n  same requirement file. (3830)\n- Support installing from Git refs (3876)\n- Use pkg_resources to parse the entry points file to allow names with colons.\n  (3901)\n- ``-q`` specified once correctly sets logging level to WARNING, instead of\n  CRITICAL. Use `-qqq` to have the previous behavior back. (3994)\n- Shell completion scripts now use correct executable names (e.g., ``pip3``\n  instead of ``pip``) (3997)\n- Changed vendored encodings from ``utf8`` to ``utf-8``. (4076)\n- Fixes destination directory of data_files when ``pip install --target`` is\n  used. (4092)\n- Limit the disabling of requests&#39; pyopenssl to Windows only. Fixes\n  &quot;SNIMissingWarning / InsecurePlatformWarning not fixable with pip 9.0 /\n  9.0.1&quot; (for non-Windows) (4098)\n- Support the installation of wheels with non-PEP 440 version in their\n  filenames. (4169)\n- Fall back to sys.getdefaultencoding() if locale.getpreferredencoding()\n  returns None in `pip.utils.encoding.auto_decode`. (4184)\n- Fix a bug where `SETUPTOOLS_SHIM` got called incorrectly for relative path\n  requirements by converting relative paths to absolute paths prior to calling\n  the shim. (4208)\n- Return the latest version number in search results. (4219)\n- Improve error message on permission errors (4233)\n- Fail gracefully when ``/etc/image_version`` (or another distro version file)\n  appears to exists but is not readable. (4249)\n- Avoid importing setuptools in the parent pip process, to avoid a race\n  condition when upgrading one of setuptools dependencies. (4264)\n- Fix for an incorrect ``freeze`` warning message due to a package being\n  included in multiple requirements files that were passed to ``freeze``.\n  Instead of warning incorrectly that the package is not installed, pip now\n  warns that the package was declared multiple times and lists the name of each\n  requirements file that contains the package in question. (4293)\n- Generalize help text for ``compile``/``no-compile`` flags. (4316)\n- Handle the case when ``/etc`` is not readable by the current user by using a\n  hardcoded list of possible names of release files. (4320)\n- Fixed a ``NameError`` when attempting to catch ``FileNotFoundError`` on\n  Python 2.7. (4322)\n- Ensure USER_SITE is correctly initialised. (4437)\n- Reinstalling an editable package from Git no longer assumes that the\n  ``master`` branch exists. (4448)\n- This fixes an issue where when someone who tries to use git with pip but pip\n  can&#39;t because git is not in the path environment variable. This clarifies the\n  error given to suggest to the user what might be wrong. (4461)\n- Improve handling of text output from build tools (avoid Unicode errors)\n  (4486)\n- Fix a &quot;No such file or directory&quot; error when using --prefix. (4495)\n- Allow commands to opt out of --require-venv. This allows pip help to work\n  even when the environment variable PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV is set.

codepen:\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/Zhephyr54/pen/ZEEbGWO\r\n(Scroll down to the \"Show callout\" button)\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior:\r\n\r\nUsing a Callout with doNotLayer, preventDismissOnScroll and preventDismissOnLostFocus (for a fully controlled component), when the Callout is actually displayed while the target element is off-screen (not visible at this moment), the Callout positioning is incorrect (it appears to be the closest to the target element while being still visible on screen).\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nThe Callout positions itself properly in relation to the target element even when the target element is not visible on screen.\r\n\r\n### Priorities and help requested:\r\n\r\nAre you willing to submit a PR to fix?

You can also specify the reject row (dirty row) count, percentage row count, and location to save rejected row messages on said reads.\r\n\r\nRejected rows are dirty rows that do not fit into the defined schema or data model of the table. This can commonly be header files that are not skipped or just semi-structured data that has not been fully defined by the external table. \r\n\r\n> 90 rows rejected from external table [TableName] in plan step 2 of query execution:\r\n>Location: '/folder/MyData1.csv' Column ordinal: 5, Expected data type: NVARCHAR(2048) collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS.\r\n>Location: '/folder/MyData2.csv' Column ordinal: 5, Expected data type: NVARCHAR(2048) collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS.\r\n>Location: '/folder/MyData3.csv' Column ordinal: 5, Expected data type: NVARCHAR(2048) collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS.\r\n>Location: '/folder/MyData4.csv' Column ordinal: 5, Expected data type: NVARCHAR(2048) collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS.\r\n> 86 other error messages similar to the above\r\n\r\nWhen you query an external table in Azure Data Warehouse using pyodbc that has rejected row messages as the above either with T-SQL or via Stored Procedure, pyodbc will silently fail giving no errors and end the connection to the database. That means, if you have a multi-statement Stored Procedure that populates 2 or more tables with INSERTS or reads 2 or more External Tables that have these dirty rows, the first table succeeds, but the second and so forth will never INSERT or read because the connection will close due to the messages returned.\r\n\r\nThe only solution is to ensure all External Tables have zero dirty row messages. This is a bug because the table itself is allowed to have dirty rows and still succeed in most cases. Common dirty row is a header row if not defined to skip N rows by the External Table. Another common dirty row is a Totals row for aggregated data."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/comments/541979083","html_url":"https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/634#issuecomment-541979083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/634","id":541979083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTk3OTA4Mw==","user":{"login":"TehFamine","id":5091791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTE3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5091791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine","html_url":"https://github.com/TehFamine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TehFamine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:25Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Updated to 4.0.27 and updated the server driver to 17, still same results.

The biggest change is that WakeLockController\nwas merged into WakeLock itself.\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, though, the API now looks like a mix of the\nold, navigator-based API and the one we implemented a few months ago:\n\n* The main idea is that WakeLock.request() no longer returns a promise that\n  does not resolve while the lock is held, as that is not very intuitive.\n  Instead, it returns a new WakeLockSentinel object.\n* WakeLockSentinel is a new interface that can release() a lock and receive\n  \"release\" events.\n* We do go back to a Navigator-based API, but we also support\n  WorkerNavigator.\n* There is no WakeLockRequest interface or state tracking in the WakeLock\n  interface.\n* WakeLock.requestPermission() was removed.\n* Consequently, we now have a WakeLockEvent interface.\n\nThe changes to the spec still need to land, but there is some rough\nconsensus on what the API should look like, and we do not want to miss the\nM79 branch cut.\n\nBug: 257511, 1010162\nChange-Id: If1baed914ccd9eb7103a1bb71a40529976777ec2\nReviewed-on: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1849683\nReviewed-by: Kentaro Hara <haraken@chromium.org>\nReviewed-by: Bo <boliu@chromium.org>\nReviewed-by: Reilly Grant <reillyg@chromium.org>\nCommit-Queue: Raphael Kubo da Costa <raphael.kubo.da.costa@intel.com>\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#705632}","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/web-platform-tests/wpt/commits/1a69ff8bc7a40d2e37ce0ce822e980a94bad9333"},{"sha":"38c2e8d53c9e54f5c4a914d1528aff4e60f07cdf","author":{"name":"autofoolip","email":"0d612c12d2ac33625bf3e0351b6f5e4f73829fa8@foolip.org"},"message":"Update interfaces/mediasession.idl (#19680)\n\nSource: https://github.com/tidoust/reffy-reports/blob/4d7ad55/ed/idl/mediasession.idl\r\nBuild: https://travis-ci.org/tidoust/reffy-reports/builds/597780528","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/web-platform-tests/wpt/commits/38c2e8d53c9e54f5c4a914d1528aff4e60f07cdf"},{"sha":"20a55f606de85d95a46cd19b423c9215cb39898c","author":{"name":"Morten Stenshorne","email":"f0c0567e887539ebd0e817b4f3eeaf2dd3286d90@chromium.org"},"message":"The block-offset of a spanner may affect layout.\n\nWe already had code that copied to the block-offset from the spanner\nplaceholder to the actual spanner layout object, but we also need to\nmake sure that it actually gets laid out.\n\nSee test: In the initial layout pass we'd set the block-size of the\nfirst column row (with the empty DIV) to the block-size of the multicol\ncontainer. Then we'd bump into the spanner, and realize that this\nblock-size wouldn't do, since we need to balance columns in front of a\nspanner. Because of this initial block-size of the column row, the\ninitial layout pass of the spanner would put the spanner below that,\ntricking the machinery into believing that we need a break inside the\nspanner. In the next layout pass the block-size of the column row would\nbe corrected, and also the position of the spanner.

This is not consistent with the Fx Schematic grouping, which allows any nodes to be group.\r\n\r\nLogic has been updated to remove the connection requirement, allowing any combination of nodes to be grouped in the Stage Schematic.\r\n\r\nThis change was a result of a couple of users who couldn't understand why Stage Schematic nodes couldn't be grouped sometimes.  I couldn't find a reason why the connection requirement was needed, and tests without it did not appear to have any negative impact or side

My code is like this doesn't work. Error 404.\r\n```\r\n$routes->group('admin', ['namespace' => '\\Admin\\Controllers\\Auth'], function ($routes){\r\n    $routes->add('(.*)/(.*)', '$1/$2');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the guide, it should be possible to pass the controller and method name from URL during this. I tried and it works to pass it as method argument and display it in the controller.\r\n\r\nIt works like this to redirect everything from /admin/* to some defined controller in another namesapce defined like below.\r\n```\r\n$routes->group('admin', ['namespace' => '\\Admin\\Controllers\\Auth'], function ($routes){\r\n    $routes->add('(.*)', 'myController');\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't worka as well.

I am assuming it tries to pass segments as arguments to not defined controller all the time and can not pass it as controller name.\r\n\r\n**CodeIgniter 4 version**\r\n4.0.0 rc-2 - develop branch\r\n\r\n**Affected module(s)**\r\n- Router\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour, and steps to reproduce if appropriate**\r\nWith this code, I expect to pass the first segment after \"admin\" as controller name and second segment as the method with the defined namespace.

(see https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/3810#issuecomment-475481710 )\r\n\r\nThe only operation that has been dispatched in this PR is the gabor filter, although many other functions, especially those that use the convolve function, for which the shim is already there, could easily be accelerated in the same way. (GPU code in _shared, gabor swapped over to using gpu in filters)\r\n\r\nOn @jni's recommendation I've vendored GPUtools (https://github.com/maweigert/gputools) because it is quite immature, and the lead author is not very responsive. However, it is mature enough to be useful for our purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation:\r\n\r\nIt is a recurring issue that skimage is slower than a few other libraries that offer similar functionality, partly by design, favouring instead a stable ecosystem, convenient and pythonic API, and good documentation. A good increase in speed could be had by dispatching common and critical functions to faster, hardware accelerated code with a transparent shim, thereby gaining lots of 'low hanging fruit' speedups, without changing the interface or increasing complexity singificantly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, gputools uses openCL, which means speedups can occur across all sorts of hardware (as opposed to CUDA, which is exclusively nVidia). This means even low-power laptop computers could potentially see a big speed increase.\r\n\r\n## Other critical operations\r\n\r\nCreating a dispatch for operations that are used in most operations, like convolve and fft would mean that a huge portion of code could be sped up without much extra maintainence actually needing to be done. This means you get most of the benefit without having to write or maintain your own openCL code.\r\n\r\n## Minimally disruptive\r\n\r\nBecause of the way the PR is written, there should be nothing that is backwards-compatibility breaking. Using any of the gpu functions is opt-in, with an environment variable check at import time. Even once the decision to use gpu functions is made, all operations should automatically fallback in cases where gputools doesn't support the same options. In future, different levels of 'eagerness' could be defined in an env var, since many of the incompatibilities are options users may not care that much about, like certain boundary padding strategies.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nI have created a benchmark for the gabor filter along the same way that sobel is tested. Note that asv needs to be run with the `--launch-method=spawn` flag, or it will hang when using gputools function. (https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv/issues/883) (https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/commands.html#asv-run))\r\n\r\nOn my laptop with integrated graphics (linux: Ubuntu 18.04, cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30GHz ,num_cpu 4, ram 7905384), using the same benchmark used for the sobel filter, GPU acceleration takes 18.5 seconds, whereas using the gabor filter with ndi takes 53 seconds. This showcases a clear speedup even on systems without powerful graphics cards, which means most users should see some benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nThe only thing that needs to happen is for the dependencies to be installed, and for the environment variable SKIMAGE_USE_GPU to be set.\r\n\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/comments/541979152","html_url":"https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4215#issuecomment-541979152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4215","id":541979152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTk3OTE1Mg==","user":{"login":"stefanv","id":45071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/45071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:37Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Once we have two different code paths (opencl, cpu) for calculating the same result, we should test those results against one another."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:38Z","org":{"id":897180,"login":"scikit-image","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/scikit-image","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/897180?"}}

Please fill out the following template, which will help other contributors review your Pull Request. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Make sure you’ve read the contribution guidelines here: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis pull request enables compiling on Aarch64, while retaining full previous compatibility.\r\nI still need someone who can test against PowerPC.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I've added SIMDe as a dependency, which provides an audited universal SIMD abstraction layer.\r\nThis provides full performance for the native intrinsics, while allowing relatively fast translation for aarch64.\r\nSIMDe also includes Hedley, an acceleration layer that can improve performance of existing code.\r\nI've converted all currently used x86 intrinsics to use the SIMDe layer.\r\nI've enabled automatic aarch64 detection in cmake.\r\n**EDIT** \r\nSIMDe is no longer a dependency, I took a snapshot of the files actually used and put them in libobs/util/aarch.\r\nI've written an abstraction layer to translate between the native intrinsics and SIMDe.\r\nThis abstraction layer is only used when aarch64 is detected, otherwise everything stays as normal.\r\n\r\nShould additional intrinsics that I haven't included in the abstraction layer be added to the project, I will have to manually add them here as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nAarch64 hardware has reached a point where it is viable as a streaming platform.\r\nBy allowing OBS-Studio to compile on aarch64 platforms, we open it up to use on the most common computing platform in the world.\r\nThis can be used as a platform for enabling new features and more robust hardware accelerated video encoding.\r\nFurther down the line, I hope to have a plugin to allow OBS-Studio to use Gstreamer as a hardware acceleration platform.\r\nSince Gstreamer is starting to support Windows, and is relatively common on Linux, this would also provide a fallback method for x86 streaming.\r\n**EDIT**\r\nThere is prototype obs-gstreamer code that provides hardware acceleration in the dev branch.\r\nIt is still under development and the hardware acceleration code needs work to function on specific boards.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis has been compile tested on the rk3328 platform.\r\nThis has been compile and run tested on the Jetson Nano platform running the Linux4Tegra OS (Ubuntu 18.03 with nVidia binaries).\r\nThis is not compatible yet with nVidia Tegra running nouveau, due to it lacking any functional hardware decoding.\r\nCompiles successfully on x86/x64.\r\n**Needed** Test on PowerPC.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\nNew feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nSupports aarch64.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

So a call to `<grpc_service_name>.<dtab_namespace_prefix>` resolves to `grpc_service_name` at discovery, matching what the gRPC client is sending on the channel.\r\n\r\n### Any alternatives you've considered?\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution would be running N number of control planes for K clusters and M regions. Makes up for a segmented service mesh/graph that requires extra tooling and aggregation on top of. This makes operation a lot harder and is not natively supported.\r\n\r\nThe tooling would fill up the gap between what is setup in the infrastructure vs. what the developers of the service would like to see on their end on the dashboards, configs, etc.\r\n\r\n### How would users interact with this feature?\r\n\r\nThis can start with the same dashboard mechanism, with the service graph being aware of the cluster and/or region names as some sort of a metadata (labels?) in every segregated cloud environment.\r\n\r\nFederation beyond an environment is a nice to have, but not a deal breaker for migrating from 1 to 2."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/comments/541979160","html_url":"https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/2876#issuecomment-541979160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/2876","id":541979160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTk3OTE2MA==","user":{"login":"wmorgan","id":4026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan","html_url":"https://github.com/wmorgan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmorgan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:38Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We have a draft doc describing one approach here.

This is not consistent with the Fx Schematic grouping, which allows any nodes to be group.\r\n\r\nLogic has been updated to remove the connection requirement, allowing any combination of nodes to be grouped in the Stage Schematic.\r\n\r\nThis change was a result of a couple of users who couldn't understand why Stage Schematic nodes couldn't be grouped sometimes.  I couldn't find a reason why the connection requirement was needed, and tests without it did not appear to have any negative impact or side

Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## What is GitHub?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they're invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\n\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\n\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\n\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\n\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\n\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\n\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!\n\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\n<hr>\n</details><br>\n\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\n\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\n\n### More features\n\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\n\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that’s in-progress in this project dashboard\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\n\n### Special Files\n\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\n\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n### Using issues\n\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\n\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\n\n\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\n\n## Using GitHub issues\n\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\n\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\n\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\n<hr>\n\n## Managing notifications\n\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\n\nOnce you've commented on an issue or pull request, you'll start receiving email notifications when there's activity in the thread.  \n\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\n\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\n2. Under _\"Notifications\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\n\nYou'll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\n\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\n\n### Repository notification options\n\n* **Watch**: You'll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \n* **Not watching**: You'll no longer receive notifications unless you're @-mentioned\n* **Ignore**: You'll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\n\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you're watching\n\n1. Click your profile icon\n2. Click **Settings**\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\n4. Click on the [repositories you’re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\n6.

That's how android works\n- because of the user permission, some files like /proc/<pid>/{environ,exe} can't be read.\n\nThis results in a very small process list.\n\nThis is a local run on my machine\n```\n(lldb) platform process list\n2 matching processes were found on \"remote-android\"\nPID    PARENT USER       TRIPLE                   NAME\n====== ====== ========== ======================== ============================\n23291  3177              aarch64-unknown-linux-android sh\n23301  23291            aarch64-unknown-linux-android lldb-server\n```\nHowever, I have 700 processes running at this time.\n\nBy implementing a few fallbacks for android, I've expanded this list to 202, filtering out kernel processes, which would presumably appear in this list if the device was rooted.\n\n```\n(lldb) platform process list\n202 matching processes were found on \"remote-android\"\nPID    PARENT USER       TRIPLE                   NAME\n====== ====== ========== ======================== ============================\n...\n12647  3208              aarch64-unknown-linux-android sh\n12649  12647             aarch64-unknown-linux-android lldb-server\n12653  982                                        com.samsung.faceservice\n13185  982                                        com.samsung.vvm\n15899  982                                        com.samsung.android.spay\n16220  982                                        com.sec.spp.push\n17126  982                                        com.sec.spp.push:RemoteDlcProcess\n19772  983                                        com.android.chrome\n20209  982                                        com.samsung.cmh:CMH\n20380  982                                        com.google.android.inputmethod.latin\n20879  982                                        com.samsung.android.oneconnect:Receiver\n21212  983                                        com.tencent.mm\n24459  1                 aarch64-unknown-linux-android wpa_supplicant\n25974  982                                        com.samsung.android.contacts\n26293  982                                        com.samsung.android.messaging\n28714  982                                        com.samsung.android.dialer\n31605  982                                        com.samsung.android.MtpApplication\n32256  982                                        com.bezobidny\n```\n\nSomething to notice is that the architecture is unkonwn for all apks. And that's fine, because run-as would be required to gather this information and that would make this entire functionality massively slow.\n\nThere are still several improvements to make here, like displaying actual user names, which I'll try to do in a following diff.\n\nNote: Regarding overall apk debugging support from lldb. I'm planning on having lldb spawn lldb-server by itself with the correct user, so that everything works well. The initial lldb-server used for connecting to the remote platform can be reused for such purpose. Furthermore, eventually lldb could also launch that initial lldb-server on its own.\n\nDifferential Revision: D68289\n\nllvm-svn: 374853","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apple/llvm-project-v3/commits/d04855f820c5f21c2ae95e711bf003af575e58e3"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:49Z","org":{"id":10639145,"login":"apple","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/apple","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10639145?"}}

This resolves #69. I wanted to try an approach that more explicitly broke out image sequence parameters and had awareness of timing associated with frames. This also avoids using format strings in urls which could become ambiguous or need complex escaping logic if a url encoding includes a `%` (e.x. `%20` for a space).\r\n\r\nThe image sequence is expressed with:\r\n- `target_url_base` - everything leading up to the file name in the `target_url`\r\n- `name_prefix` - everything in the file name leading up to the frame number\r\n- `name_suffix` - everything after the frame number in the file name\r\n- `start_value` - first frame number used in file names\r\n- `value_step` - step between frame numbers in file names (every other frame is a step of 2)\r\n- `frame_duration` - RationalTime duration of a frame (`1/frame_rate`)\r\n- `image_number_zero_padding` - Number of digits to pad zeros out to (e.x. frame 10 with a pad of 4 would be `0010`)\r\n\r\nAn example for 24fps media with a sample provided each frame numbered 1-1000 with a path `/show/sequence/shot/sample_image_sequence.%04d.exr` might be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"available_range\": {\r\n    \"start_time\": {\r\n      \"value\": 0,\r\n      \"rate\": 24\r\n    },\r\n    \"duration\": {\r\n      \"value\": 1000,\r\n      \"rate\": 24\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"start_value\": 1,\r\n  \"value_step\": 1,\r\n  \"frame_duration\": {\r\n    \"value\": 1,\r\n    \"rate\": 24\r\n  },\r\n  \"target_url_prefix\": \"file:///show/sequence/shot/sample_image_sequence.\",\r\n  \"image_number_zero_padding\": 4,\r\n  \"target_url_postfix\": \".exr\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same duration sequence but with only every 2nd frame available in the sequence would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"available_range\": {\r\n    \"start_time\": {\r\n      \"value\": 0,\r\n      \"rate\": 24\r\n    },\r\n    \"duration\": {\r\n      \"value\": 1000,\r\n      \"rate\": 24\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"start_value\": 1,\r\n  \"value_step\": 2,\r\n  \"frame_duration\": {\r\n    \"value\": 2,\r\n    \"rate\": 24\r\n  },\r\n  \"target_url_prefix\": \"file:///show/sequence/shot/sample_image_sequence.\",\r\n  \"image_number_zero_padding\": 4,\r\n  \"target_url_postfix\": \".exr\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA target url is generated using the equivalent of the following python format string:\r\n`f\"{target_url_prefix}{(start_value + (sample_number * value_step)):0{value_zero_padding}}{target_url_postfix}\"`\r\n\r\nBenefits of this approach include:\r\n\r\n- The ability to derive the times each image map to\r\n- Avoids having to support and potentially implement a rich format string system in otio\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n\r\n- A bit heavier than using format strings\r\n- Not as flexible/extensible as format strings\r\n\r\nQuesions:\r\n\r\n- Are there names for any of these properties that would be clearer?\r\n- Should `number_of_images_in_sequence` be a property or method in python?\r\n- Would the interface be easier to use if `frame_duration` were changed to be `frame_rate`?

Are collection of media samples\r\n2. Lack metadata to map a given sample to its time\r\n3. Have constant frame rate\r\n\r\nGiven OTIO is all about timing information, my goal was to encode metadata allowing the media reference to provide a consuming application with the URL for \"on-disk\" assets it would need to render a given time range.\r\n\r\nI really like the previous suggestions about having an enum to specify missing frame behavior preference. My one concern with this approach is strictly what constitutes a \"missing\" frame. I think this implicit behavior about whether or not certain assets exist could result in a lot of odd error cases.\r\nOne hypothetical case could be where you've rendered every other frame in a 24fps sequence but a few of them landed on the network store with the wrong permissions. You might specify the sequence as \"hold last known frame\" expecting to get a 12fps version of the clip back. In this case you could get back a video that is a bit all over the place with the application raising no errors. These types of I/O problems are even more pronounced in cloud environments where you're either pre-downloading or on-demand downloading frames. Since networks are inherently unreliable, it's very important to capture errors so you can retry. For these cases I think it would be really nice if we were explicit to the application using the frames about exactly what source assets to expect so it can error appropriately.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, a use case that comes to mind that is related is \"chunked\" files. This is where each file contains a sub-range of the source's avaliable range. This is typically done to conform to some arbitrary file size limit, RED R3D files are a common case. If you think of frame files as \"chunked\" files where the time range they contain is the duration of a single frame then these two concepts are interchangeable. However I think the best idea would be to model that case separately as something like `ChunkedSequenceReference`."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-15T00:00:50Z","org":{"id":1672744,"login":"PixarAnimationStudios","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/PixarAnimationStudios","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1672744?"}}
