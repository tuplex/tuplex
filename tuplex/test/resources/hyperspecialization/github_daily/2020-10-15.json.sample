changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<p>This document lists breaking changes for each major release.</p>\n<p>See the GitHub Releases page for detailed changelogs:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/releases\">https://github.com/release-it/release-it/releases</a></p>\n<h2>v14</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed <code>global</code> property from plugins. Use <code>this.config[key]</code> instead.</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated <code>npm.access</code> option. Set this in <code>package.json</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v13</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped support for Node v8</li>\n<li>Dropped support for GitLab v11.6 and lower.</li>\n<li>Deprecated <code>scripts</code> are removed (in favor of <a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it#hooks\">hooks</a>).</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated <code>--non-interactive</code> (<code>-n</code>) argument. Use <code>--ci</code> instead.</li>\n<li>Removed old <code>%s</code> and <code>[REV_RANGE]</code> syntax in command substitutions. Use <code>${version}</code> and <code>${latestTag}</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v12</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>--follow-tags</code> argument for <code>git push</code> has been moved to the default configuration. This is only a breaking\nchange if <code>git.pushArgs</code> was not empty (it was empty by default).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v11</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The custom <code>conventional-changelog</code> increment (e.g. <code>&quot;increment&quot;: &quot;conventional:angular&quot;</code>) with additional script\nconfiguration is replaced with a plugin. Please see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/master/docs/changelog.md#conventional-changelog\">conventional changelog</a>\nhow to use this plugin.</li>\n<li>The <code>pkgFiles</code> option has been removed. If there's a need to bump other files than what <code>npm version</code> bumps, it should\nbe (part of) a plugin.</li>\n<li>By default, the latest version was derived from the latest Git tag. From v11, if the repo has a <code>package.json</code> then\nthat <code>version</code> is used instead. The <code>use</code> option has been removed. Also see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it#latest-version\">latest version</a>.</li>\n<li><code>scripts.changelog</code> has been moved to <code>git.changelog</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v10</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped support for Node v6</li>\n<li>Deprecated options from v9 are removed, the <code>dist.repo</code> config in particular (also see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/master/docs/recipes/distribution-repo.md\">distribution repository</a> for\nalternatives).</li>\n<li>Drop the <code>--debug</code> flag. <code>DEBUG=release-it:* ...</code> still works.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v9</h2>\n<p>There should be no breaking changes, but there have been major internal refactorings and an improved UI. A bunch of new\nfeatures and bug fixes have been implemented.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<p>This document lists breaking changes for each major release.</p>\n<p>See the GitHub Releases page for detailed changelogs:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/releases\">https://github.com/release-it/release-it/releases</a></p>\n<h2>v14</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed <code>global</code> property from plugins. Use <code>this.config[key]</code> instead.</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated <code>npm.access</code> option. Set this in <code>package.json</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v13</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped support for Node v8</li>\n<li>Dropped support for GitLab v11.6 and lower.</li>\n<li>Deprecated <code>scripts</code> are removed (in favor of <a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it#hooks\">hooks</a>).</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated <code>--non-interactive</code> (<code>-n</code>) argument. Use <code>--ci</code> instead.</li>\n<li>Removed old <code>%s</code> and <code>[REV_RANGE]</code> syntax in command substitutions. Use <code>${version}</code> and <code>${latestTag}</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v12</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>--follow-tags</code> argument for <code>git push</code> has been moved to the default configuration. This is only a breaking\nchange if <code>git.pushArgs</code> was not empty (it was empty by default).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v11</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The custom <code>conventional-changelog</code> increment (e.g. <code>&quot;increment&quot;: &quot;conventional:angular&quot;</code>) with additional script\nconfiguration is replaced with a plugin. Please see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/master/docs/changelog.md#conventional-changelog\">conventional changelog</a>\nhow to use this plugin.</li>\n<li>The <code>pkgFiles</code> option has been removed. If there's a need to bump other files than what <code>npm version</code> bumps, it should\nbe (part of) a plugin.</li>\n<li>By default, the latest version was derived from the latest Git tag. From v11, if the repo has a <code>package.json</code> then\nthat <code>version</code> is used instead. The <code>use</code> option has been removed. Also see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it#latest-version\">latest version</a>.</li>\n<li><code>scripts.changelog</code> has been moved to <code>git.changelog</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v10</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped support for Node v6</li>\n<li>Deprecated options from v9 are removed, the <code>dist.repo</code> config in particular (also see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/master/docs/recipes/distribution-repo.md\">distribution repository</a> for\nalternatives).</li>\n<li>Drop the <code>--debug</code> flag. <code>DEBUG=release-it:* ...</code> still works.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v9</h2>\n<p>There should be no breaking changes, but there have been major internal refactorings and an improved UI. A bunch of new\nfeatures and bug fixes have been implemented. Last but not least, the configuration structure is changed significantly.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/2ccf01fd242309840020cfa82034ade4851c6cf7\"><code>2ccf01f</code></a> Release 14.0.4</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/e5f63e81a16ddc9d7b65cd719bd50f15395d5f16\"><code>e5f63e8</code></a> Update dependencies</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/f94257371947f94c3a666d73f1835bc8596a8d70\"><code>f942573</code></a> Make full context available for git.tagName (closes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/release-it/release-it/issues/708\">#708</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/229ed755e23c19706c5fd77cbdc547901ca84aba\"><code>229ed75</code></a> Add note about cancelled hooks when related lifecycle method failed or was sk...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/2b02a634e9292b57cc97a837b5a8e1fadeb4fa22\"><code>2b02a63</code></a> Add note about <code>npm whoami</code> and npmrc token (closes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/release-it/release-it/issues/704\">#704</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/35b596899141df4be98b1769219b797b62f4d1a7\"><code>35b5968</code></a> Release 14.0.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/d925920c49d91ac7f0fabe245e7d44ac47ea97ca\"><code>d925920</code></a> Update dependencies</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/9411fb0400d6f1e877d5e71da2c685b8f6f4389e\"><code>9411fb0</code></a> Ignore unsupported <code>npm access</code> for e.g. Nexus environments (fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/release-it/release-it/issues/700\">#700</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/be98df3d359de9b19f742a81f5cd483c7808ef64\"><code>be98df3</code></a> Add Git info to GitHub releases docs (closes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/release-it/release-it/issues/698\">#698</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/commit/c0e69f59acc5185dd76d29a508acb74a3b651721\"><code>c0e69f5</code></a> Release 14.0.2</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it/compare/13.7.0...14.0.4\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=release-it&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=13.7.0&new-version=14.0.4)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score/?dependency-name=release-it&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=13.7.0&new-version=14.0.4)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

For the element's `resource` I included a new property called `output` with the video mimeType (`video/mp4`) and a `src` (a link to the full sized mp4), as well as `sizes.mp4` and `sizes.webm` in case we would like to support both sources in the future. Also open to changing `elements/gif/output` to support both by default.\r\n\r\n> As I mentioned previously, I think the cleanest way to achieve this would be by making gif a first-class citizen here.\r\n> To give an example, we currently have a couple of instances like this in the code base:\r\n```\r\nif (resource.type == 'gif') {\r\n  resource.type = 'image';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n> Adding more checks like this is going to make things overly complex and prone to errors (should we ever forget to add such a check anywhere).\r\n\r\n- With the above in consideration, I created a new folder `gif` which leverages the `image` element type in its `index.js` but then renders a new component for output: `gif/output`. I removed modifications to `resource.type` in `useInsertElement` and `mediaElement` to treat gifs as first-class citizens, and changed a check in `media/edit` to treat the `gif` type as an image.\r\n\r\n- gifs uploaded from local have `resource.type = 'image'` so no modifications were required to render those properly\r\n\r\n- \r\n\r\n## To-do\r\n\r\n- [x] `elements/gif/test` it should produce valid AMP output\r\n- [x] `elements/gif/test` it should produce an AMP video with autoplay, no controls, no audio, and loop\r\n- [x] `app/media/utils/test` `getResourceFromMedia3P` should return a valid shape for `gif` type resources\r\n- [x] get a rundown on Karma so I can better determine if an e2e test would be appropriate here. I don't think so, but I'd love to learn something new. 🧠\r\n\r\n## User-facing changes\r\n\r\nThere should be no perceptible difference to the user from these changes.\r\n\r\n## Testing Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Open a new story in the editor\r\n2. Go to the images tab and click on \"GIFs\"\r\n3. Double click a gif to add it to the editor\r\n4. Click Preview to preview the story\r\n5. Right-click on the gif in the preview pane and select \"Inspect Element in your browser's context menu\r\n6. The gif should be rendered as an `<amp-video />` element e.g.\r\n<img width=\"1023\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 3 20 05 PM\"

The 2s delay for requests from inbound peers still exists, but after that, if viable outbound peers remain for any given transaction, they will always be tried first.\n  * No more hard cap of 100 in flight transactions per peer, as there is less need for it (memory usage is linear in the number of announcements, but independent from the number in flight, and CPU usage isn't affected by it). Furthermore, if only one peer announces a transaction, and it has over 100 in flight already, we still want to request it from them. The cap is replaced with a rule that announcements from such overloaded peers get an additional 2s delay (possibly combined with the existing 2s delays for inbound connections, and for txid peers when wtxid peers are available).\n  * The limit of 100000 tracked announcements is reduced to 5000; this was excessive. This can be bypassed using the PF_RELAY permission (to accommodate locally dumping a batch of many transactions).\n\n  This replaces #19184, rebased on #18044 and with many small changes.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  ariard:\n    Code Review ACK fd9a006.

The worker also sends periodic heartbeats to keep its tasks in sync with what the dispatcher thinks its tasks should be. This led to the following race condition:\n\n1. Worker finishes task T.\n2. Worker erases T.\n3. Worker heartbeats to the dispatcher. Dispatcher sees that the worker is not working on T, and tells it to start working on T. Worker starts T from the beginning.\n4.

Whoops. All code checking for AIs has been replaced with checking for silicons instead.\r\n\r\nIn addition, silicons no longer have the recall emergency button available to them. It didn't work in the first place, but now it gives a clear message.\r\n\r\nFixes #54380.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from merging your PR! -->\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n:cl:\r\nfix: Cyborgs can now interact with the communications console just like the AI.\r\nfix: Silicons are no longer given the option to recall. It didn't work in the first place, but now it gives a clear message.\r\nfix: The allied sectors list now properly goes down, rather than horizontal.\r\n/:cl:\r\n\r\n<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your GitHub username as author ingame. -->\r\n<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags, changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents.

Once the instance is running, you connect to the instance, and\n+create a service object to expose the instance.\n+\n+The following service types are supported:\n+\n+* `ClusterIP` - Connect using service IP and service port inside the cluster network.\n+* `NodePort` - Connect using node IP and node port outside the cluster network.\n+* `LoadBalancer` - Connect using public IP and port.\n+\n+This procedure presents an example of how to create and expose a service object of type `ClusterIP`\n+as a virtual machine-backed service.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+Labels on a `VirtualMachineInstance` are passed through to the pod.

Choose a descriptive `name` for the service you are creating and exposing.\n+Unlike `type`, which must contain specific values, you can choose any descriptive name\n+for the service. In this example, note that the `name` is `vmiservice`, but for a\n+node port service, you might choose the name `nodeport`.

Are there commands to start and connect to the VirtualMachineInstance that you can supply? I feel they should be at the start of the procedure (before current step #1).\r\n\r\n2. For this Note: **Labels on a VirtualMachineInstance are passed through to the pod. The labels on the VirtualMachineInstance must match the labels on the Service object.** --- is this referring to the `special: key:` label in both VMI and Service YAML? If so I can highlight that with a callout.\r\n\r\n3. In the U/S doc there is another approach (using virtctl) to expose the services. A general rule in doc is to give the user the one, best, most consistently successful way of doing a task. Is it your opinion we can leave the virtctl method out of this procedure? We could also put a link to the upstream doc in the assembly but that might lead to confusion as to what doc to follow. I'm open to any ideas or suggestions as I think you have a better grasp of the user audience here. I can of course add a note about using virtctl as well.\r\n\r\n4. I am assuming the user can select any service name they like, unlike type which seems to have predefined valid values. Let me know if this is correct. I tried to emphasize that the service name should be descriptive to the service being created and exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-10T17:15:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-15T00:00:20Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1223d47f3542455c3cbccdb567574d5d004b94b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vikram-redhat","id":3347559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDc1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3347559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat","html_url":"https://github.com/vikram-redhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":751797317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTE3OTczMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openshift/openshift-docs/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"ee9900","default":false,"description":"Denotes

Are there commands to start and connect to the VirtualMachineInstance that you can supply? I feel they should be at the start of the procedure (before current step #1).\r\n\r\n2. For this Note: **Labels on a VirtualMachineInstance are passed through to the pod. The labels on the VirtualMachineInstance must match the labels on the Service object.** --- is this referring to the `special: key:` label in both VMI and Service YAML? If so I can highlight that with a callout.\r\n\r\n3. In the U/S doc there is another approach (using virtctl) to expose the services. A general rule in doc is to give the user the one, best, most consistently successful way of doing a task. Is it your opinion we can leave the virtctl method out of this procedure? We could also put a link to the upstream doc in the assembly but that might lead to confusion as to what doc to follow. I'm open to any ideas or suggestions as I think you have a better grasp of the user audience here. I can of course add a note about using virtctl as well.\r\n\r\n4. I am assuming the user can select any service name they like, unlike type which seems to have predefined valid values. Let me know if this is correct. I tried to emphasize that the service name should be descriptive to the service being created and exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-10T17:15:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-15T00:00:20Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1223d47f3542455c3cbccdb567574d5d004b94b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vikram-redhat","id":3347559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDc1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3347559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat","html_url":"https://github.com/vikram-redhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikram-redhat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":751797317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTE3OTczMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openshift/openshift-docs/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"ee9900","default":false,"description":"Denotes

rslint's ignore command is either scoped to the entire file or its scoped to the statement or declaration its on top of. This does not seem to be the norm apparently, i would like to keep scoping as it is and instead add a more explicit modifier to the ignore command as such:\r\n\r\nignoring an entire statement:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// rslint-ignore no-empty\r\nif (foo) {}\r\nelse {} // no error\r\n```\r\n\r\nignoring a block of code until another line:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// rslint-ignore no-empty until 5\r\n{}\r\n{}\r\n{}\r\n{}\r\n{} // error\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could also add `rslint-ignore <rules> until eof`? i really prefer an explicit command such as this over weird scoping you cannot make sense of, which is the case with eslint (in my opinion)\r\n\r\n# Mentoring instructions \r\nTo add this you will need to modify the directive parser which is found [here](https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/blob/master/rslint_core/src/directives/parser.rs), ignore commands are parsed [here](https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/blob/master/rslint_core/src/directives/parser.rs#L275). What i would personally do is add two more variants to the commands enum called `IgnoreRulesUntil(Vec<Box<dyn CstRule>>, Range<usize>)` and `IgnoreUntil(Range<usize>)` where the ranges are start and end byte indices. You will need to cache the byte indices of line starts in the directive parser which is very easy, you can simply do it once when the directive parser is created, you can get the source code text through `root_node.text().to_string()`. To parse the actual directive you can simply peek the lexer to see if the next token's text is `until` and then further peek to see if its a number or `eof`. Then to enforce the directives you can simply add something to [the place where rules are run](https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/blob/master/rslint_core/src/lib.rs#L96), run through all of the directives, if any directive applies to the rule (ignoreUntil applies to all rules, IgnoreRulesUntil only applies if the rule is contained) then go through all of the diagnostics returned, if the first primary label of the diagnostic's range start is included in the directive's range then simply remove the diagnostic (`Vec::retain` can do this easily).\r\n\r\nYou will also need to update the docs [here](https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/blob/master/docs/directives.md) to document this.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RDambrosio016/RSLint/issues/comments/708722225","html_url":"https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/issues/23#issuecomment-708722225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RDambrosio016/RSLint/issues/23","id":708722225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODcyMjIyNQ==","user":{"login":"cristianossd","id":4166006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjYwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4166006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd","html_url":"https://github.com/cristianossd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristianossd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-15T00:00:23Z","updated_at":"2020-10-15T00:00:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@RDambrosio016, I think some references on your mentoring instructions should be updated.

When inspect tool event triggers in gweb apache tries to run the `xport --start ... ` command in gweb graph.php and then I see `rrdcached error: no such file or directory` in /var/log/apache2/error.log. Basically, it cannot run that command via rrdcached. The rrd files in `/var/lib/ganglia/rrds` being updated by rrdcached and rrdcached daemon working. If I remove the rrdcached socket from gweb conf.php, the inspect tool starts working as expected (since now the requests do not go through rrdcached).\r\n\r\n_Note: manually running the `rrdtool xport --start ...` command extracted from a graph.php request on the server also gave `rrdcached: permission denied` error at first but when I update the rrdcached to run with `FETCH` option in `-P` it started working and giving output on the cmd line._\r\n\r\nrrdcached daemon: `/usr/bin/rrdcached -s ganglia -m 777 -l unix:/tmp/rrdcached.sock -s nogroup -m 777 -P FLUSH,STATS,HELP,FETCH -l unix:/tmp/rrdcached.limited.sock -F -b /var/lib/ganglia/rrds/ -B -w {VALUE} -z {VALUE} -f {VALUE} -t {VALUE} -p /tmp/rrdcached.pid`\r\n\r\nOwnership: `/tmp/rrdcached*` files have `nobody:nogroup` ownership and the `/var/lib/ganglia/rrds` have `ganglia:www-data. Apache runs as `www-data:www-data`. \r\n\r\nI think it is somewhat related to the permissions of files of some sort but I have the same setup in a different environment which is running rrdtool 1.4.7 on ubuntu14 and it works fine. \r\n\r\nIs there anything that changed between the older version and newer version in terms of permissions that might be causing this issue? \r\nAnother question - would it be too expensive if gweb does not use rrdcached to get the data?

The failures were caused in the following situations:\r\n\r\nPlotting a Vector plot of POINTS/velocity.\r\nPlotting a Pseudocolor plot of POINTS/mass_density scaled by POINTS/hmin.\r\n\r\nThese variables are actually expressions involving conn_cmfe expressions mapping polyhedral data onto point meshes. The problem occurs when there is more than one conn_cmfe involved in the plot. In the case of the Vector plot it had one for the x component of velocity and another for the y component of velocity. In the case of the Pseudocolor plot, there is the variable for the plot and the variable for the scaling.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when the first conn_cmfe is generated, it is converted to VTK_POLY_DATA. This occurs in the post execute for avtDataObjectToDatasetFilter, which all the expression filters inherit from. I don't know why this is done. I will file a question issue to see if anyone knows. It's been there a long time. The name it is given is the name of the point mesh. When it goes to evaluate the second conn_cmfe it grabs the same variable since the names match. I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it works. I will file an issue with this as well. The reused variable is now poly data, but the logic that handles mappings between point meshes and polyhedral meshes was only looking for VTK_UNSTRUCTURED_GRID. I enhanced the logic to also look for VTK_POLY_DATA.\r\n\r\n### Type of change\r\n\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested both the Vector plot and Pseudocolor plot in the

It's been a while since I've contributed here, LOL. \r\n  But anyway, I've been thinking a lot about this topic. Many people want to tell Monika their sexuality, but if they're gay, for example, it would be difficult to come up with a response. The idea for her reply has been, \"Well, I guess I'm the exception!\" It has been thought to sound a bit homophobic.\r\n  I thought of a lot of different ways for her to say that in a _nicer_ way, ahah. \r\n\r\nHere's one idea:\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" (1wud)\r\n\"...\" (1duc)\r\n\"Ahaha, sorry, I just didn't expect you to say that!\" (1rksdla)\r\n\"You know since you downloaded this mod and all.\" (4eksdlb)\r\n\"I don't really know the right way to put this...\" (2rksdlb)\r\n\"But with all the time we've spent together,\" (1ekbla)\r\n\"I think you know that that could never affect the way I see you.\"(3ekbla)\r\n\"Just know that I support you no matter what, _player._\" (1hubfb)\r\n\"Thank you for being open-minded enough to spend your time with me, though.\" (1ekbfa)\r\n\"I personally am _player_-sexual.\" (1kua) - Maybe we wouldn't include this part LOL. It's just something I would say. But I know Monika likes to make jokes - so I don't know.\r\n\"Ahahah!\" (1hksdlb)\r\n\"Sorry, that was weird.\" (1lksdla)\r\n\"I'll always love you, _player_!\" (3hubfb)\r\n\r\nAnd somewhere in there, maybe there could be a, \"I don't have anything against that stuff. Love who you want!\"\r\nBut I feel like in this example it may sound a bit homophobic (because it would imply she was the exception). It would also have to be left out for an example such as when a female player says she's straight or something.\r\n\r\n  If this still sounds a bit homophobic, I'm sorry. I never intended for it to sound that way - I, myself, am a lesbian. I just think this sounds better than, \"I guess I'm the exception!\"\r\n\r\nThis may be a duplicate, and if so, I'm sorry.
