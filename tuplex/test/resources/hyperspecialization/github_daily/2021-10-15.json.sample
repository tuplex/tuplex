Thank you for your contribution! Please review https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst before opening a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please add a reviewer to the assignee section when you create a PR. If you don't have the access to it, we will shortly find a reviewer and assign them to your PR. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are these changes needed?\r\n\r\nAdd the functionality to retrieve metadata for a workflow or workflow step.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\n- Similar to `get_output`, this will either return the metadata for workflow (`workflow.get_metadata(workflow_id)`) or the metadata for a specific step (`workflow.get_metadata(workflow_id, step_id)`)\r\n- Exceptions will only be raised if workflow id or step id not exist. Canceled job, running job, etc. will return proper metadata by retrieving information from checkpoint. See [here](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/8c8ca609d7fb65ee0032ad2a352f6332f46f466f/python/ray/workflow/tests/test_metadata_get.py#L67) for more details.\r\n- Returned metadata is an aggregated result from multiple checkpoint files based on previous [discussion](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/17090#issuecomment-920481789). The aggregation logic is [here for step metadata](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/8c8ca609d7fb65ee0032ad2a352f6332f46f466f/python/ray/workflow/workflow_storage.py#L451) and [here for workflow metadata](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/8c8ca609d7fb65ee0032ad2a352f6332f46f466f/python/ray/workflow/workflow_storage.py#L484) which can be tuned with further discussion.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\n>>>  user_step_metadata = {\"k1\": \"v1\"}\r\n>>>  user_run_metadata = {\"k2\": \"v2\"}\r\n>>>  step_name = \"simple_step\"\r\n>>>  workflow_id = \"simple\"\r\n\r\n>>>  @workflow.step\r\n>>>  def simple():\r\n>>>      return 0\r\n\r\n>>>  simple.options(name=step_name, metadata=user_step_metadata).step().run(workflow_id, metadata=user_run_metadata)\r\n\r\n# get workflow-level metadata\r\n>>>  workflow.get_metadata(\"simple\")\r\n{'status': 'SUCCESSFUL',\r\n 'user_metadata': {'k2': 'v2'},\r\n 'stats': {'start_time': 1634173413.116535, 'end_time': 1634173413.149051}}\r\n\r\n# get step-level metadata\r\n>>> workflow.get_metadata(\"simple\", \"simple_step\")\r\n{'name': '__main__.simple',\r\n 'step_type': 'FUNCTION',\r\n 'workflows': [],\r\n 'max_retries': 3,\r\n 'workflow_refs': [],\r\n 'catch_exceptions': False,\r\n 'ray_options': {},\r\n 'user_metadata': {'k1': 'v1'},\r\n 'stats': {'start_time': 1634173413.131262, 'end_time': 1634173413.1347651}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short summary of the change and the problem this solves. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/17090\r\n<!-- For example: \"Closes #1234\" -->\r\n\r\n## Checks\r\n\r\n- [x] I've run `scripts/format.sh` to lint the changes in this PR.\r\n- [ ] I've included any doc changes needed for https://docs.ray.io/en/master/.\r\n- [x] I've made sure the tests are passing.

Also, since this is a very simple macro, it didn't merit, in my opinion, dropping to a full procedural macro.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant was\r\n```rust\r\ngenerate_tag_functions! { enum HtmlTag { ... } }\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```rust\r\n#[apply(generate_tag_functions)]\r\nenum HtmlTag { ... }\r\n```\r\nbecause they are equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Sure, we can remove these, though I can imagine some workflows, especially with dynamic tables or virtual lists where this kind of optimization could be useful. Perhaps mark the function as unsafe? (though this might break the builder flow) If not, I'm fine with removing it.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to do something about this with type-states but I think that belongs in another PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sycamore-rs/sycamore/issues/comments/943848792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-10-15T00:00:08Z","org":{"id":83153330,"login":"sycamore-rs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/sycamore-rs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83153330?"}}

pass on this code. @ananda1066 is signed up to propagate the usage of this system a little further once this lands, so she should take a look too!\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n- delete the old resource quota system\r\n- introduce resource_quota/api.{h,cc} as the gRPC surface API/channel args hooks to manipulate the new system\r\n- everywhere: rely on channel args to carry resource quota to where it's needed - this affects surface calls (we need to ensure that there's a resource quota set in channel args at that point), but also meant some churn on tests that access grpc internals\r\n- the above helps repair an ambiguity whereby we didn't know whether we should take the resource quota from channel args or from some other argument (though EE will *likely* want the explicit passing we've talked about previously)\r\n\r\nA corresponding cherry-pick internal CL will be needed prior to landing these changes.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer review in GitHub, since I get a touch confused with

is mostly ready for review (there's a few ASAN leaks, will fix tonight/tomorrow - but I expect those changes to be more editorial).\r\n\r\nTagging @drfloob for primary review since he recently did a pass on this code. @ananda1066 is signed up to propagate the usage of this system a little further once this lands, so she should take a look too!\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n- delete the old resource quota system\r\n- introduce resource_quota/api.{h,cc} as the gRPC surface API/channel args hooks to manipulate the new system\r\n- everywhere: rely on channel args to carry resource quota to where it's needed - this affects surface calls (we need to ensure that there's a resource quota set in channel args at that point), but also meant some churn on tests that access grpc internals\r\n- the above helps repair an ambiguity whereby we didn't know whether we should take the resource quota from channel args or from some other argument (though EE will *likely* want the explicit passing we've talked about previously)\r\n\r\nA corresponding cherry-pick internal CL will be needed prior to landing these changes.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer review in GitHub, since I get a touch confused with

If you don't want to package a particular version please close the PR.\n\n**NEW: If you want these PRs to be merged automatically, make an issue with <code>@conda-forge-admin,</code>`please add bot automerge` in the title and merge the resulting PR. This command will add our new bot automerge feature to your feedstock!**\n\n\n\nIf this PR was opened in error or needs to be updated please add the `bot-rerun` label to this PR. The bot will close this PR and schedule another one. If you do not have permissions to add this label, you can use the phrase <code>@<space/>conda-forge-admin, please rerun bot</code> in a PR comment to have the `conda-forge-admin` add it for you.\n\n<sub>This PR was created by the [regro-cf-autotick-bot](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts).\nThe **regro-cf-autotick-bot** is a service to automatically track the dependency graph, migrate packages, and propose package version updates for conda-forge. If you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!\nThis PR was generated by https://github.com/regro/autotick-bot/actions/runs/1343918753, please use this URL for debugging</sub>\n\nDependency Analysis\n--------------------\n\nPlease note that this analysis is **highly experimental**.

This means that, on CRuby, the pre-v1.12.0 behavior is restored.</p>\n<p>Users who want to turn this behavior off may pass a keyword argument to the Builder constructor like so:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\"><code>Nokogiri::XML::Builder.new(namespace_inheritance: false)\n</code></pre>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance\">https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance</a> for example usage.</p>\n<h4>Downstream gem maintainers</h4>\n<p>Note that any downstream gems may want to specifically omit Nokogiri v1.12.0--v1.12.3 from their dependency specification if they rely on child namespace inheritance:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This is not convenient and error prone. We want to add open registration support for torch::deploy builtins so that people only need to add one effective line of code in there *library code* to complete the registration.\n\nHere is an example to registry numpy as torch::deploy builtins:\n  REGISTER_TORCH_DEPLOY_BUILTIN(numpy, numpy_frozen_modules, <list of name, PyInit function pairs>)\n\nThis diff supports open registration of frozen modules. It's the first step to achieve the plan above.\nghstack-source-id: 139888306\n\nTest Plan: Run tests in test_deploy.cpp and test_builtin_registry.cpp\n\nReviewed By: suo\n\nDifferential Revision: D31321562\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 6445bd8869f1bb7126b4c96cf06c31145f0e9445","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/commits/6c54971cd99eee39f7a5e878690578ae33149fae"},{"sha":"67970e8c9b326e8e5d6e30ce652ec965f3599f3f","author":{"name":"Priya Ramani","email":"12218611501186c426d2a3e06836b097d8d74272@fb.com"},"message":"Add CI tests for AOT Compile (#65441)\n\nSummary:\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65441\n\nAdding CI test to verify a simple linear model can compile fine.\nSuccessful run from CI logs:\n\n```\n+ test_aot_model_compiler\n+ echo 'Testing AOT model compiler'\nTesting AOT model compiler\n+ source test/mobile/nnc/test_aot_compile.sh\n+++ python -c 'import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])'\n++ TORCH_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch\n++ TORCH_BIN_DIR=/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/bin\n+++ dirname test/mobile/nnc/test_aot_compile.sh\n++ CURRENT_DIR=test/mobile/nnc\n++ MODEL=aot_test_model.pt\n++ COMPILED_MODEL=aot_test_model.compiled.pt\n++ COMPILED_CODE=aot_test_model.compiled.ll\n++ test_aot_model_compiler\n++ python test/mobile/nnc/aot_test_model.py\n++ exit_code=0\n++ [[ 0 != 0 ]]\n++ /opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/bin/test_aot_model_compiler --model aot_test_model.pt --model_name=aot_test_model --model_version=v1 --input_dims=2,2,2\nThe compiled model was saved to aot_test_model.compiled.pt\n++ success=1\n++ '[' '!' -f aot_test_model.compiled.pt ']'\n++ '[' '!' -f aot_test_model.compiled.ll ']'\n++ '[' -f aot_test_model.compiled.ll ']'\n++ rm aot_test_model.compiled.ll\n++ '[' -f aot_test_model.compiled.pt ']'\n++ rm aot_test_model.compiled.pt\n++ rm aot_test_model.pt\n++ '[' 1 = 0 ']'\n+ [[ linux-xenial-py3.6-gcc5.4-default == pytorch-linux-xenial-py3* ]]\n+ assert_git_not_dirty\n+ [[ linux-xenial-py3.6-gcc5.4-default != *rocm* ]]\n+ [[ linux-xenial-py3.6-gcc5.4-default != *xla* ]]\n++ git status --porcelain\n+ git_status=\n+ [[ -n '' ]]\n+ test_custom_script_ops\n```\n\nTest Plan: Imported from OSS\n\nReviewed By: ljk53\n\nDifferential Revision: D31348169\n\nPulled By: priyaramani\n\nfbshipit-source-id: dd5c55859dfa07d150e5decc2dd7e56f43e7f66b","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/commits/67970e8c9b326e8e5d6e30ce652ec965f3599f3f"},{"sha":"300613dc607f65373202b3128fa0c35b866e6ac8","author":{"name":"Horace He","email":"79a077482c640ba78c074f0f254322a8ae39200d@yahoo.com"},"message":"make FX symbolic tracing reuse buffers if they're the same (#66211)\n\nSummary:\nCurrently, if the same tensor constant is reused multiple times, we'll store a tensor constant for each time we use it.\n\nFor example\n```\nval = torch.randn(5)\nfor _ in range(10):\n    x = x + val\n```\nends up storing 10 tensor constants.\n\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/66211\n\nReviewed By: jamesr66a\n\nDifferential Revision: D31437089\n\nPulled By: Chillee\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 401169c8d58ce0afb7025ae11060680ef544419f","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/commits/300613dc607f65373202b3128fa0c35b866e6ac8"},{"sha":"0cab25468d36b1fd8b39b91dcbdde9a213b022a5","author":{"name":"Chen Lai","email":"82c3031b24639c7cd0624992cf36523cc7ffc984@fb.com"},"message":"[Pytorch Edge][tracing-based] reorganize model tracer dependency (#63421)\n\nSummary:\n1. move 4 files to :\n```\nKernelDTypeTracer.h\nKernelDTypeTracer.h\nOperatorCallTracer.h\nOperatorCallTracer.h\n```\nso it's visible in OSS.\n\n2.

the bug**\r\nIf a user accidentally passes an [end_time](https://github.com/AICoE/prometheus-api-client-python/blob/master/prometheus_api_client/prometheus_connect.py#L162) that is before [start_time](https://github.com/AICoE/prometheus-api-client-python/blob/master/prometheus_api_client/prometheus_connect.py#L161) ( like I did :) ), then the `get_metric_range_data` function returns an empty list instead of throwing an error.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Instantiate `PrometheusConnect` object\r\n2. Using this object call the `get_metric_range_data` func with end_time < start_time\r\n3. See empty list\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf the user were to make this timestamp switcharoo while using the `custom_query_range` function, then the HTTP code 400 would returned with the message `end timestamp must not be before start time`.

Briefly, I see two main issues which this would address:\r\n\r\n1. Greater intelligibility of the architecture. The wide range of packages/actions/etc. called in the CI workflow (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pangeo-forge/flow-charts/main/renders/ci-flow-with-callstack.png) makes it hard to understand where various parts of the system live, and how therefore how to maintain/extend them.\r\n2. Migrating CI logic out of GitHub Actions and into Python. We would still use Actions, of course, but they would just invoke logic from the central orchestration Python package, not implement that logic themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is no way a criticism of what's been built so far, but rather a reflection about adapt and grow from here.","created_at":"2021-10-15T00:00:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T00:00:43Z","html_url":"https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pull/1#discussion_r729428188","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pulls/1","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pulls/comments/729428188"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pull/1#discussion_r729428188"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pulls/1"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pulls/comments/729428188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":11,"start_side":"RIGHT","line":null,"original_line":12,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":728413184},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pulls/1","id":750147387,"node_id":"PR_kwDOGKcjPc4stlc7","html_url":"https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pull/1","diff_url":"https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pull/1.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/pull/1.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/issues/1","number":1,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Minimal CLI","user":{"login":"cisaacstern","id":62192187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTkyMTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62192187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern","html_url":"https://github.com/cisaacstern","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cisaacstern/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"A first draft of CLI functionality related to https://github.com/pangeo-forge/roadmap/pull/37.

A further ADR and community discussion will be needed regarding whether to include such an object in Pangeo Forge and, if so, its specification and implementation details. Briefly, the purpose of the object would be to tie the provenance of datasets in a given storage location back to their corresponding feedstocks and recipes. Among other things, this aids cataloging, insofar as the cataloging tooling (which ideally can generate catalog items based on crawling storage buckets) will need to be aware of information in the feedstocks (i.e. `meta.yaml`s).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> <code>pangeo-forge bakery ls --bakery-id 'great_bakery' --view build-logs </code>

Feel free to push to the bot's branch to update this PR if needed.\n2. The bot will almost always only open one PR per version.\nChecklist before merging this PR:\n- [ ] Dependencies have been updated if changed: see [upstream](https://github.com/mrparkers/terraform-provider-keycloak)\n- [ ] Tests have passed \n- [ ] Updated license if changed and `license_file` is packaged \n\nNote that the bot will stop issuing PRs if more than 3 Version bump PRs generated by the bot are open. If you don't want to package a particular version please close the PR.\n\n**NEW: If you want these PRs to be merged automatically, make an issue with <code>@conda-forge-admin,</code>`please add bot automerge` in the title and merge the resulting PR. This command will add our new bot automerge feature to your feedstock!**\n\n\n\nIf this PR was opened in error or needs to be updated please add the `bot-rerun` label to this PR. The bot will close this PR and schedule another one. If you do not have permissions to add this label, you can use the phrase <code>@<space/>conda-forge-admin, please rerun bot</code> in a PR comment to have the `conda-forge-admin` add it for you.\n\n<sub>This PR was created by the [regro-cf-autotick-bot](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts).\nThe **regro-cf-autotick-bot** is a service to automatically track the dependency graph, migrate packages, and propose package version updates for conda-forge. If you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!\nThis PR was generated by https://github.com/regro/autotick-bot/actions/runs/1343918753, please use this URL for debugging</sub>\n\nHere is a list of all the pending dependencies (and their versions) for this repo.

The aim here is to make maintenance easier by inspecting the package's dependencies. Importantly this analysis does not support optional dependencies, please double check those before making changes. If you do not want hinting of this kind ever please add `bot: inspection: false` to your `conda-forge.yml`. If you encounter issues with this feature please ping the bot team `conda-forge/bot`.\n\nAnalysis of the source code shows **no** discrepancy between the library's imports and the package's stated requirements in the meta.yaml.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/terraform-provider-keycloak-feedstock/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/terraform-provider-keycloak-feedstock/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/terraform-provider-keycloak-feedstock/issues/comments/943850162","html_url":"https://github.com/conda-forge/terraform-provider-keycloak-feedstock/pull/21#issuecomment-943850162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/terraform-provider-keycloak-feedstock/issues/21","id":943850162,"node_id":"IC_kwDODtBxOs44QgKy","user":{"login":"conda-forge-linter","id":18567580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTY3NTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18567580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter","html_url":"https://github.com/conda-forge-linter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conda-forge-linter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T00:00:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T00:00:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nHi!

(I was actually hoping the it'd work with your permalinks, but that's unfortunately not the case, likely because those pages are built dynamically).\r\n\r\nFor the numbers, I wasn't referring to page numbers, I think we can handle those (CSL has `page` which refers to a page range and `number-of-pages` which refers to the total number of pages), but to the numbers that should be displayed with authors. If you take e.g. the Fenner et al. reference, correct template would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{Cite journal|\r\n doi = 10.1038/s41597-019-0031-8|\r\n issn = 2052-4463|\r\n volume = 6|\r\n issue = 1|\r\n pages = 28|\r\n last1 = Fenner|\r\n first1 = Martin|\r\n last2 = Crosas|\r\n first2 = Mercè|\r\n last3 = Grethe|\r\n first3 = Jeffrey S.|\r\n last4 = Kennedy|\r\n first4 = David|\r\n last5 = Hermjakob|\r\n first5 = Henning|\r\n last6 = Rocca-Serra|\r\n first6 = Phillippe|\r\n last7 = Durand|\r\n first7 = Gustavo|\r\n last8 = Berjon|\r\n first8 = Robin|\r\n last9 = Karcher|\r\n first9 = Sebastian|\r\n last10 = Martone|\r\n first10 = Maryann|\r\n last11 = Clark|\r\n first11 = Tim|\r\n title = A data citation roadmap for scholarly data repositories|\r\n journal = Scientific Data|\r\n accessdate = 2019-04-27|\r\n date = 2019-04-10|\r\n url = http://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0031-8}}\r\n```\r\n there's no way CSL can handle the consecutive numbering. Without it, multiple authors are ambiguous.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm not dead set against this and certainly open to be convinced -- the goal of making it easier to insert references into WP is certainly worthwhile","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/citation-style-language/styles/issues/comments/943850445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-10-15T00:01:04Z","org":{"id":526476,"login":"citation-style-language","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/citation-style-language","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526476?"}}

RTLD_BOOTSTRAP is also used on dl-machine.h on various\n     architectures and it changes the semantics of various machine\n     relocation functions.\n\n  2. The elf_get_dynamic_info() change was done sideways, previously\n     to 490e6c62aa get-dynamic-info.h was included by the first\n     dynamic-link.h include *without* RTLD_BOOTSTRAP being defined.\n     It means that the code within elf_get_dynamic_info() that uses\n     RTLD_BOOTSTRAP is in fact unused.\n\nTo fix 1. this patch now includes dynamic-link.h only once with\nRTLD_BOOTSTRAP defined.  The ELF_DYNAMIC_RELOCATE call will now have\nthe relocation fnctions with the expected semantics for the loader.\n\nAnd to fix 2. part of 4af6982e4c is reverted (the check argument\nelf_get_dynamic_info() is not required) and the RTLD_BOOTSTRAP\npieces are removed.\n\nTo reorganize the includes the static TLS definition is moved to\nits own header to avoid a circular dependency (it is defined on\ndynamic-link.h and dl-machine.h requires it at same time other\ndynamic-link.h definition requires dl-machine.h defitions).\n\nAlso ELF_MACHINE_NO_REL, ELF_MACHINE_NO_RELA, and ELF_MACHINE_PLT_REL\nare moved to its own header.  Only ancient ABIs need special values\n(arm, i386, and mips), so a generic one is used as default.\n\nThe powerpc Elf64_FuncDesc is also moved to its own header, since\ncsu code required its definition (which would require either include\nelf/ folder or add a full path with elf/).\n\nChecked on x86_64, i686, aarch64, armhf, powerpc64, powerpc32,\nand powerpc64le.\n\nReviewed-by: Szabolcs Nagy <szabolcs.nagy@arm.com>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bminor/glibc/commits/d6d89608ac8cf2b37c75debad1fff653f6939f90"},{"sha":"9d3c9a046a2d7cfc9cad18675612e5916c65d7d7","author":{"name":"H.J.

We have opened #1341 and realized that maybe this is the reason during our investigations, but as not sure if the 2 is connected I'm reporting this separately for now.\r\n\r\nWhat is important to this ticket is that we run 3 FTP services per machine, FTP, FTPs and sFTP. As we are having clients from different networks behind different firewalls, and a loadbalancer for high availablity purposes, we are using PassivePorts. \r\n\r\nOur testing showed in investigation that only FTP is having an issue with not respecting the PassivePorts configuration we have set. FTPs and sFTP is respecting and good. \r\n\r\nOur testing environment is currently set at 1.3.7c and our PROD is at 1.3.5e.\r\n\r\n### What I Expected/Wanted\r\n\r\nI have reviewed the changelog and haven't seen any addition on changing this behavior, and also as 2 out of our 3 services are not having the issue it is more then strange.\r\n\r\n### LOGS from testing environment 1.3.7c\r\n\r\nOur passive port range is 50000 50100\r\n\r\nTesting with a simple curl login\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Connecting to ftp.loadbalancer.ip (ftp.loadbalancer.ip) port 57632\r\n* Connecting to ftp.loadbalancer.ip

To keep up, various hardware accelerators have added ML-specific computing units such as Tensor Cores in Nvidia GPUs, MXUs (Matrix Multiplication Units) in TPUs, etc. CPU vendors have also recently adopted this trend: Intel has added int8 vectorization ([AVX512_VNNI](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/avx512_vnni)) to its CPUs starting in 2019, bfloat16 vectorization ([AVX512_BF16](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/avx512_bf16)) in 2020, and will soon release the new Advanced Matrix Extension ([AMX](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/amx)) instructions [early next year](https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/06/29/intel-delays-sapphire-rapids-server-chips-confirms-hbm-memory-option/). Arm announced its [bfloat16 hardware support plan](https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/ai-and-ml-blog/posts/bfloat16-processing-for-neural-networks-on-armv8_2d00_a) in 2019 and launched the [Neoverse-V1](https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/neoverse-v1-platform-a-new-performance-tier-for-arm) CPU with both bfloat16 vectorization and int8 2x2 matrix multiply instructions (I8MM) in April 2021. IBM introduced its Matrix-Multiply Assist ([MMA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03142.pdf)) instructions in 2020.\n+\n+As CPUs become more diverse and powerful, it is important that TensorFlow can properly utilize these new instructions when they are available. However, most standard TensorFlow CPU kernels are implemented with the [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), which lacks proper dynamic support for this task. TensorFlow is pursuing two parallel efforts to address this: compilers and vendor-optimized libraries. The compiler-based approach will be done through XLA and MLIR. This RFC discusses a library-based approach. Official TensorFlow Linux packages currently only support x86 platforms, so we are focusing on the [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN) for x86 CPUs.\n+\n+oneDNN is a library of performant deep learning primitives with bleeding edge support for new Intel CPUs. It detects CPU architecture at runtime and dynamically generates specialized kernels with the best available vector instructions (just-in-time compilation). [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html) (TF-oneDNN) is a separate TensorFlow build / package ([`intel-tensorflow`](https://pypi.org/project/intel-tensorflow/)) which replaces a set of compute-intensive standard TF ops at runtime with custom ops that builds upon oneDNN primitives. TF-oneDNN has been used in Google Cloud deep learning images, in Anaconda, and on supercomputers over the past few years. Beginning with TF 2.5, we have incorporated several key oneDNN custom ops into default TensorFlow packages. These ops are not used unless users enable them through an environment variable. This RFC proposes turning them on by default to maximize the benefits. \n+\n+## User Benefits\n+\n+Enabling oneDNN-based operations will bring benefits of TF-oneDNN to default TensorFlow packages.\n+* **Performance speedups on x86 CPUs.** oneDNN’s primitives are highly optimized. Its just-in-time compilation and dynamic dispatch also let it use available hardware instructions efficiently. Enabling custom oneDNN ops achieves throughput speedups up to [3⨉ in inference and 2.4⨉ in training](https://medium.com/intel-analytics-software/leverage-intel-deep-learning-optimizations-in-tensorflow-129faa80ee07) on a Cascade Lake CPU.\n+* **Timely support of new hardware features in Intel CPUs.** oneDNN can use new Intel hardware instructions as soon as they are launched. TF-oneDNN receives the same benefit.\n+* **Mixed precision computation on CPU.** Default TF CPU ops don’t support bf16/fp32 mixed precision computations yet. oneDNN ops enable this feature on CPU. We observed additional [1.7-1.9⨉ speedups](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/06/accelerating-ai-performance-on-3rd-gen-processors-with-tensorflow-bfloat16.html) with bfloat16 hardware vectorization on a Cooper Lake CPU.\n+* **Additional int8 / quantization support on CPU.** oneDNN ops have more int8 coverage than default TF CPU ops. We also observed [3-4⨉ speedups](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/posts/accelerating-tensorflow-inference-with-intel-deep-learning-boost-on-2nd-gen-intel-xeon-scalable-processors.html) on top of software quantization benefits with int8 hardware vectorization on a Cascade Lake CPU.\n+\n+## Design Proposal\n+\n+The design consists of three main components: oneDNN custom ops, graph rewrite passes, and a software-managed cache.\n+\n+**oneDNN custom ops** are TensorFlow ops that perform some set up (e.g., creating oneDNN compute primitives, memory descriptors, etc) before calling oneDNN routines.\n+* **Visibility:** These custom ops are hidden from users in the Python layer, cannot be saved in SavedModels, and are only introduced into the TensorFlow graph by graph rewrite passes in the C++ layer.\n+* **Scope and signature:** Most ops have a 1:1 mapping to a standard TensorFlow op, with the same op signatures (inputs, attributes, outputs, etc). The rest are fused operations (one op is equivalent to a sequence of standard TensorFlow ops).\n+* **Expected tensor format:** oneDNN ops process tensors directly in TensorFlow’s native format (NHWC), e.g., no tensor layout conversions.","path":"rfcs/20210930-enable-onednn-ops.md","position":46,"original_position":46,"commit_id":"9ffcdd0e070481a4ccac9e959e5cd7311d4d4606","original_commit_id":"9ffcdd0e070481a4ccac9e959e5cd7311d4d4606","user":{"login":"Jianhui-Li","id":23248843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjQ4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23248843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li","html_url":"https://github.com/Jianhui-Li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jianhui-Li/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"I understand that for activation, we want to hide the blocked layout completely.

Does anyone have any tips?\r\n\r\nBy bad signal I mean that a temp/humidity sensor within 2 meters that has line-of-sight to the antenna on the stick gets a linkquality of like 20-30.  A plug-in-repeater _in the same room_ and only three meters away doesn't connect at all (or when it does, only shows up with a linkquality of zero). I've tried all sorts of things like:\r\n\r\n- Changed all my Ubiquiti AP's to channels 1 and 6\r\n- Tried different 2.4 ghz antennas on the stick (the standard 3dbi one and a 6dbi one I had laying about)\r\n- Ran the stick into a different room with a USB extension cable\r\n- Purchased more plug in routers (I have three ikea ones and four osram-offbrands) \r\n- Updated Zigbee2Mqtt to version 1.21.0\r\n\r\nYet nothing helps. Even with the repeaters, I can just _barely_ get the signal to cover the room that the coordinator antenna is in, let alone go through walls. \r\n\r\nIs my stick broken? Do I have some undiscovered yet extremely powerful source of 2.4 ghz noise coming from somewhere? Is my house simply cursed? Should a buy a heavily shielded USB extension cable and a CC2652P dongle?\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.

Feel free to push to the bot's branch to update this PR if needed.\n2. The bot will almost always only open one PR per version.\nChecklist before merging this PR:\n- [ ] Dependencies have been updated if changed: see [upstream](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations)\n- [ ] Tests have passed \n- [ ] Updated license if changed and `license_file` is packaged \n\nNote that the bot will stop issuing PRs if more than 3 Version bump PRs generated by the bot are open. If you don't want to package a particular version please close the PR.\n\n**NEW: If you want these PRs to be merged automatically, make an issue with <code>@conda-forge-admin,</code>`please add bot automerge` in the title and merge the resulting PR. This command will add our new bot automerge feature to your feedstock!**\n\n\n\nIf this PR was opened in error or needs to be updated please add the `bot-rerun` label to this PR. The bot will close this PR and schedule another one. If you do not have permissions to add this label, you can use the phrase <code>@<space/>conda-forge-admin, please rerun bot</code> in a PR comment to have the `conda-forge-admin` add it for you.\n\n<sub>This PR was created by the [regro-cf-autotick-bot](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts).\nThe **regro-cf-autotick-bot** is a service to automatically track the dependency graph, migrate packages, and propose package version updates for conda-forge. If you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!\nThis PR was generated by https://github.com/regro/autotick-bot/actions/runs/1343918753, please use this URL for debugging</sub>\n\nDependency Analysis\n--------------------\n\nPlease note that this analysis is **highly experimental**. The aim here is to make maintenance easier by inspecting the package's dependencies. Importantly this analysis does not support optional dependencies, please double check those before making changes. If you do not want hinting of this kind ever please add `bot: inspection: false` to your `conda-forge.yml`. If you encounter issues with this feature please ping the bot team `conda-forge/bot`.\n\nAnalysis of the source code shows a discrepancy between the library's imports and the package's stated requirements in the meta.yaml.\n\n### Packages found by inspection but not in the meta.yaml:\n- ipython\n- nbformat\n- urllib3\n\n\n### Packages found in the meta.yaml but not found by inspection:\n- pytz\n","created_at":"2021-10-15T00:01:44Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T00:01:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/pulls/137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/pulls/137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/issues/137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/statuses/69c04f63318b9654425df3d9b6ac00fe1005a55f","head":{"label":"regro-cf-autotick-bot:0.13.38_hed0629","ref":"0.13.38_hed0629","sha":"69c04f63318b9654425df3d9b6ac00fe1005a55f","user":{"login":"regro-cf-autotick-bot","id":36490558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDkwNTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36490558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/regro-cf-autotick-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126558459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY1NTg0NTk=","name":"great-expectations-feedstock","full_name":"regro-cf-autotick-bot/great-expectations-feedstock","private":false,"owner":{"login":"regro-cf-autotick-bot","id":36490558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDkwNTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36490558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/regro-cf-autotick-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regro-cf-autotick-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/regro-cf-autotick-bot/great-expectations-feedstock","description":"A
