We do not patch doublewidth glyphs in, jet (afaik).\r\n\r\nThen the scaling mechanism (`ScaleGlyph`) is expanded to handle more complex situations and do so automatically.\r\n\r\nThis new mechanism is than used for the _Font Awesome_ glyphs.\r\n\r\nWith just the first commit you can see the extend of the problem.

They will be smaller then before, which is the goal of this, but people might notice.\r\n* Check font metadata, for example with\r\n    * `ttfdump FontName.ttf  | grep 'advanceWidthMax|xAvgCharWidth'`\r\n    * `showttf FontName.ttf | grep 'advanceWidthMax|avgWidth'`\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is just relevant for 'Nerd Font Mono' fonts, i.e. patched with `-mono`. Without the parameter the behavior of `font-patcher` is not changed.\r\n\r\n#### Any background context you can provide?\r\nBottom of #695, for example https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/695#issuecomment-997337500\r\n\r\nInstead of taking ONE 'main glyph' that rules the scaling of all the special glyphs, we form groups of glyphs that have to be scaled together. Like all the selected (blue) glyphs here, but as individual groups:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16012374/146665991-d822cbb8-d356-4c5a-a75c-05fb912444a7.png)\r\n\r\nThe combined bounding box of the group is determined (like when all glyphs in the group are stamped on top of each other and then the bounding box is found), and all members of the group are scaled such that the combined bounding box is maximized to the allowed limits.\r\n\r\nFor example the group of four arrows (in line 5) is scaled together, but independently to all other glyphs.\r\n\r\nHere an example that shows how Font Awesome is ... ~buggy~ strange, the selected (blue) glyphs are clearly too big for the font itself, that does maintain good glyph size consistency otherwise.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16012374/147082322-f41e6e58-64cb-4f5b-891f-499a03b569bb.png)\r\n\r\n#### What are the relevant tickets (if any)?\r\nFor example #703 (part of)\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots (if appropriate or helpful)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-22T10:59:44Z","updated_at":"2022-01-01T01:00:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bd4c0ebca9b7e4fcd8b4f9fa181e4ff931291f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2900985588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTAwOTg1NTg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/labels/Bug%20fix","name":"Bug fix","color":"E6250C","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pulls/732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pulls/732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/statuses/e805b87997bf7dbe3d99fc3582e246d8c9cb4dda","head":{"label":"ryanoasis:bugfix/monospaced-glyph-scaling","ref":"bugfix/monospaced-glyph-scaling","sha":"e805b87997bf7dbe3d99fc3582e246d8c9cb4dda","user":{"login":"ryanoasis","id":8083459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwODM0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8083459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanoasis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27574418,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU3NDQxOA==","name":"nerd-fonts","full_name":"ryanoasis/nerd-fonts","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryanoasis","id":8083459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwODM0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8083459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanoasis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts","description":"Iconic font aggregator, collection, & patcher. 3,600+ icons, 50+ patched fonts: Hack, Source Code Pro, more.

Where expected means: Fits into the normal font width. We do not patch doublewidth glyphs in, jet (afaik).\r\n\r\nThen the scaling mechanism (`ScaleGlyph`) is expanded to handle more complex situations and do so automatically.\r\n\r\nThis new mechanism is than used for the _Font Awesome_ glyphs.\r\n\r\nWith just the first commit you can see the extend of the problem. Only Font Awesome is affected:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16012374/147078396-3c0bff1e-d42a-4e15-92a9-68a2b046a79c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How should this be manually tested?\r\n* Patch a font that is not recognized as monospaced by some applications (like Gnome Terminal, Windows CMD, ...) and see if it is afterwards recognized.\r\n* Check glyphs from `FONTA_SCALE_LIST` in `fontforge` for example, if they scale to a reasonable size. They will be smaller then before, which is the goal of this, but people might notice.\r\n* Check font metadata, for example with\r\n    * `ttfdump FontName.ttf  | grep 'advanceWidthMax|xAvgCharWidth'`\r\n    * `showttf FontName.ttf | grep 'advanceWidthMax|avgWidth'`\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is just relevant for 'Nerd Font Mono' fonts, i.e. patched with `-mono`. Without the parameter the behavior of `font-patcher` is not changed.\r\n\r\n#### Any background context you can provide?\r\nBottom of #695, for example https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/695#issuecomment-997337500\r\n\r\nInstead of taking ONE 'main glyph' that rules the scaling of all the special glyphs, we form groups of glyphs that have to be scaled together. Like all the selected (blue) glyphs here, but as individual groups:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16012374/146665991-d822cbb8-d356-4c5a-a75c-05fb912444a7.png)\r\n\r\nThe combined bounding box of the group is determined (like when all glyphs in the group are stamped on top of each other and then the bounding box is found), and all members of the group are scaled such that the combined bounding box is maximized to the allowed limits.\r\n\r\nFor example the group of four arrows (in line 5) is scaled together, but independently to all other glyphs.\r\n\r\nHere an example that shows how Font Awesome is ... ~buggy~ strange, the selected (blue) glyphs are clearly too big for the font itself, that does maintain good glyph size consistency otherwise.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16012374/147082322-f41e6e58-64cb-4f5b-891f-499a03b569bb.png)\r\n\r\n#### What are the relevant tickets (if any)?\r\nFor example #703 (part of)\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots (if appropriate or helpful)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-22T10:59:44Z","updated_at":"2022-01-01T01:00:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bd4c0ebca9b7e4fcd8b4f9fa181e4ff931291f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2900985588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTAwOTg1NTg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/labels/Bug%20fix","name":"Bug fix","color":"E6250C","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pulls/732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pulls/732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/statuses/e805b87997bf7dbe3d99fc3582e246d8c9cb4dda","head":{"label":"ryanoasis:bugfix/monospaced-glyph-scaling","ref":"bugfix/monospaced-glyph-scaling","sha":"e805b87997bf7dbe3d99fc3582e246d8c9cb4dda","user":{"login":"ryanoasis","id":8083459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwODM0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8083459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanoasis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27574418,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU3NDQxOA==","name":"nerd-fonts","full_name":"ryanoasis/nerd-fonts","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryanoasis","id":8083459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwODM0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8083459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanoasis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanoasis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts","description":"Iconic font aggregator, collection, & patcher. 3,600+ icons, 50+ patched fonts: Hack, Source Code Pro, more.

As in, unless the explicit symlink path is added to Docker Prefs, it forbids the directory as a shared volume when it should notice it is allowed (and consequently allow it).\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\nIs it reproducible? Certainly, yes.\r\nIs the problem new? Yes.\r\nDid the problem appear with an update?
