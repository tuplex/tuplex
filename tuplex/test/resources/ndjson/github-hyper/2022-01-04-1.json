Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: \n \n-* **Nav files**: In the github docs site, there are yaml files under the `nav` folder that are used to determine the docs site structure that we display. This structure is exposed in the docs site left sidebar and when you view docs category views (also known as index views, like [this one](/docs/style-guide/quick-reference)). \n+* **Nav files**: In the github docs site, there are yaml files under the `nav` folder that are used to determine the docs site structure that we display. This structure is exposed in the docs site left sidebar and when you view docs category views (also known as auto-index pages, like [this one](/docs/style-guide/writing-strategies)). \n * **Folder**: In this context, \"folders\" refers to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the `content` section). Referring to \"folders\" can be a helpful way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. \n * **Sidebar**: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar and index view are both determined by the structure set in the nav file. \n-* **Category** or **sub-category**: we use these words a bit interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. For example, [this view](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started) shows a list of docs in a specific category, as does [this higher level category view](/docs/using-new-relic). In this doc, we'll often use the phrase \"category view\" to indicate a page load of a specific category of docs.  \n-* **Auto-index pages**: This is another way, the more technical way, to refer to a category view of docs (for example, [this view](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started)). \"Auto-index page\" and \"category view\" are used a bit interchangably in this doc, with \"category view\" being used as it's more informal and easy to parse. (Note that this use of \"index\" is a different use of \"index\" than the [authored index.mdx files](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/landing-page-template), which are used to display landing pages.)  \n+* **Category** or **sub-category**: we use these words a bit interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. \n+* **Auto-index pages** (mostly deprecated): This is the more technical way to refer to a category view of docs (for example, [this view](/docs/style-guide/writing-strategies)). While these views are still functional, we should no longer link to them from the docs, hence why these views are considered deprecated.","path":"src/content/docs/style-guide/writing-docs/processes-procedures/understand-edit-docs-site-structure.mdx","position":25,"original_position":25,"commit_id":"efc5d92e65a54a1b226f89c27e05270bbfb84a4e","original_commit_id":"efc5d92e65a54a1b226f89c27e05270bbfb84a4e","user":{"login":"zuluecho9","id":9435570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzU1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9435570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9","html_url":"https://github.com/zuluecho9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuluecho9/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"yeah i get that but they can still be loaded via their URLs, right?

Test times are still only at around or less than 1 minute (about +10 to 15 seconds from quick observation), probably because all images are very small anyway.\r\n\r\nThis does not check for reference-style (`[text][link]`) or in-article links (`[text](link#heading)`) yet, which I'll probably add later (could also use some more verbose notes that explain why a link is broken).\r\n\r\nNon-wiki links are assumed to start with `http`, `mailto:` or `irc:`, which are the only cases currently in the wiki.\r\n\r\nAll links in master are currently fixed by @TicClick using this in <https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/6641>. \r\n\r\nASC, readme and template articles, as well as links in comments are excluded from the test (they usually contain examples or link to other repo files).\r\n\r\nThe error message is written in the assumption that you're not a maintainer, so it doesn't actually tell you to edit `redirect.yaml`.\r\n\r\nSuggestions on output colours/formatting are welcome.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-03T18:23:15Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T01:00:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"668f377d93bcee0dae9a55080df2359c07261901","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":623695471,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2OTU0NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/labels/area:utilities","name":"area:utilities","color":"ffd300","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1555574606,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU1NTc0NjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"526EDD","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/pulls/6645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/pulls/6645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/issues/6645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/statuses/29f4b7a7c8fc3ca691d7fb17654a3e590abdb046","head":{"label":"Walavouchey:find-borked-links","ref":"find-borked-links","sha":"29f4b7a7c8fc3ca691d7fb17654a3e590abdb046","user":{"login":"Walavouchey","id":36758269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzU4MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36758269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey","html_url":"https://github.com/Walavouchey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248065694,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDgwNjU2OTQ=","name":"osu-wiki","full_name":"Walavouchey/osu-wiki","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Walavouchey","id":36758269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzU4MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36758269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey","html_url":"https://github.com/Walavouchey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Walavouchey/osu-wiki","description":"home

Test times are still only at around or less than 1 minute (about +10 to 15 seconds from quick observation), probably because all images are very small anyway.\r\n\r\nThis does not check for reference-style (`[text][link]`) or in-article links (`[text](link#heading)`) yet, which I'll probably add later (could also use some more verbose notes that explain why a link is broken).\r\n\r\nNon-wiki links are assumed to start with `http`, `mailto:` or `irc:`, which are the only cases currently in the wiki.\r\n\r\nAll links in master are currently fixed by @TicClick using this in <https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/6641>. \r\n\r\nASC, readme and template articles, as well as links in comments are excluded from the test (they usually contain examples or link to other repo files).\r\n\r\nThe error message is written in the assumption that you're not a maintainer, so it doesn't actually tell you to edit `redirect.yaml`.\r\n\r\nSuggestions on output colours/formatting are welcome.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-03T18:23:15Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T01:00:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"668f377d93bcee0dae9a55080df2359c07261901","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":623695471,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2OTU0NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/labels/area:utilities","name":"area:utilities","color":"ffd300","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1555574606,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU1NTc0NjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"526EDD","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/pulls/6645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/pulls/6645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/issues/6645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ppy/osu-wiki/statuses/29f4b7a7c8fc3ca691d7fb17654a3e590abdb046","head":{"label":"Walavouchey:find-borked-links","ref":"find-borked-links","sha":"29f4b7a7c8fc3ca691d7fb17654a3e590abdb046","user":{"login":"Walavouchey","id":36758269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzU4MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36758269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey","html_url":"https://github.com/Walavouchey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248065694,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDgwNjU2OTQ=","name":"osu-wiki","full_name":"Walavouchey/osu-wiki","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Walavouchey","id":36758269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzU4MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36758269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey","html_url":"https://github.com/Walavouchey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Walavouchey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Walavouchey/osu-wiki","description":"home
