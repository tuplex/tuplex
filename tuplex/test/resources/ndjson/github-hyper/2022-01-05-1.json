[<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2324\">#2324</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.12.4 / 2021-08-29</h2>\n<h3>Notable fix: Namespace inheritance</h3>\n<p>Namespace behavior when reparenting nodes has historically been poorly specified and the behavior diverged between CRuby and JRuby. As a result, making this behavior consistent in v1.12.0 introduced a breaking change.</p>\n<p>This patch release reverts the Builder behavior present in v1.12.0..v1.12.3 but keeps the Document behavior. This release also introduces a Document attribute to allow affected users to easily change this behavior for their legacy code without invasive changes.</p>\n<h4>Compensating Feature in XML::Document</h4>\n<p>This release of Nokogiri introduces a new <code>Document</code> boolean attribute, <code>namespace_inheritance</code>, which controls whether children should inherit a namespace when they are reparented. <code>Nokogiri::XML:Document</code> defaults this attribute to <code>false</code> meaning &quot;do not inherit,&quot; thereby making explicit the behavior change introduced in v1.12.0.</p>\n<p>CRuby users who desire the pre-v1.12.0 behavior may set <code>document.namespace_inheritance = true</code> before reparenting nodes.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html#namespace_inheritance-instance_method\">https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html#namespace_inheritance-instance_method</a> for example usage.</p>\n<h4>Fix for XML::Builder</h4>\n<p>However, recognizing that we want <code>Builder</code>-created children to inherit namespaces, Builder now will set <code>namespace_inheritance=true</code> on the underlying document for both JRuby and CRuby. This means that, on CRuby, the pre-v1.12.0 behavior is restored.</p>\n<p>Users who want to turn this behavior off may pass a keyword argument to the Builder constructor like so:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\"><code>Nokogiri::XML::Builder.new(namespace_inheritance: false)\n</code></pre>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance\">https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance</a> for example usage.</p>\n<h4>Downstream gem maintainers</h4>\n<p>Note that any downstream gems may want to specifically omit Nokogiri v1.12.0--v1.12.3 from their dependency specification if they rely on child namespace inheritance:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Please don't open any further issues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe believe the following symptoms are all caused by this:\r\n- Huge delays (up to 60 seconds) when sending messages\r\n- Failure to send anything (`TransmitStatus: Fail`)\r\n- Floods of incoming reports that are transmitted over and over\r\n- Incorrect neighbor information (e.g. controller doesn't list some/any nodes as neighbors, etc.)\r\n- Failure to heal the network or individual nodes, especially in busy situations\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdditional background info:\r\nhttps://forums.homeseer.com/forum/homeseer-products-services/homeseer-z-wave-products/smartstick/1483440-does-anyone-have-a-solid-working-g3-system-at-this-time/page4#post1510687\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**A workaround** until this is fixed is **migrating back to a 500 series stick**, using the migration tool 700<->500 series.
